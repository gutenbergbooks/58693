<h2>Preface.</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The following stories have been written by
A. L. O. E. since her arrival in India, for the
use of native readers. It is deemed most
desirable by those who thoroughly know the
people, that their minds should be trained in the first
principles of morality, as well as of religion, by means
of amusing fictions, as they are particularly fond of stories.
A. L. O. E. desires, therefore, to devote her pen to the
service of the land of her adoption, as there are, comparatively
speaking, hardly any writers who enjoy the advantage
of having the peculiar habits and failings of Hindus,
Mohammedans, Sikhs, and native converts, perpetually
brought before their notice, as is, or should be, the case
with a member of a missionary band.</p>

<p>If her little “Indian Stories” be acceptable in her dear
native land, she will be thankful; but the object which
she chiefly aims at is to write in a way to amuse, and
through amusement to instruct, the people of the country
of her adoption.</p>

<p>As stories placed in the hands of Oriental readers would
be comparatively useless unless written in an Oriental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
style, and describing scenes and customs familiar to natives,
A. L. O. E. has tried to adopt such a style, and depict
such scenes. When she reviewed her work, with the
mental question, “What would be thought of this in
England?” she felt how fanciful and affected her writings
might appear to European readers, and almost gave up all
idea of sending them home. And yet, as quaint and often
grotesque ornaments brought from the East are not despised
in Britain because they are unlike our own manufactures,
but are sometimes even prized for their very quaintness,
it is possible that a few of A. L. O. E.’s Oriental stories may
not be unacceptable in her native land. They may even
serve to awaken a little interest in a vast country like
India, where a Native Church is struggling against surrounding
evil influences,—a Church as yet small compared
with the myriads of its opponents, yet gaining strength year
by year. That infant Church needs tender care and indulgence
from those who have been brought up in a land
bathed in the light of Christianity,—a land where children
are taught almost from the cradle the value of honesty and
truth, and where little is known of the fearful difficulties
and trials which beset converts to the pure faith of the
gospel.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Fagir, the government clerk, sat in his
house, when the work of the day was
over. He had partaken of his evening
meal; he had smoked his hookah;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> his bodily
frame was at ease, but his mind was working with
many thoughts. His wife was beside him—Kasiti,
the gentle and obedient. Kasiti had long ago embraced
the gospel and become a Christian in heart,
but many months had passed before her husband
had suffered her to be baptized. He had chidden
her, and she had not answered again; he had been
harsh, and she had been loving. Kasiti<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
her faith appear beautiful by her life, and her
patience had at length won the victory. Fagir had
not only consented to his wife’s baptism, but he had
read her Bible; he had searched its pages diligently,
comparing the Old Testament with the New. And
now Fagir’s intellect was convinced of the truth of
Christianity; light dawned upon his soul, but it
was as light without warmth. Fagir believed in
Christ as the Messiah, but refused still to receive
Him as a Sacrifice for sin.</p>

<p>“Such a sacrifice is not needed; at least, for those
who walk uprightly and in the fear of God,” said
Fagir to Kasiti, who was seated at his feet, with a
Bible on her knees. “It would be mockery for
such as I am to repeat what the Christians are
taught to say—‘God be merciful to me, a sinner.’
I, at least, am no sinner, but a just and upright
man, even judged by the laws contained in that
Bible. I can hold my head erect before God and
man; for I serve God with fasting and prayer, and
man have I never wronged, but have bestowed large
alms on the poor.”</p>

<p>It was not for Kasiti to reply; she read to herself
in silence; but the thought of her heart was,
“Had not Christ died for sinners, there would have
been no heaven for me.”</p>

<p>The evening was hot; the motion of the gently-moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
punkah<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> disposed Fagir to sleep. His eyes
gradually closed, and slumber stole over him where
he sat, reclining on soft cushions. And as the weary
man slept he dreamed, and his dream was as vivid
as the realities of daily life could be.</p>

<p>Behold in his dream a beautiful angel appeared
unto Fagir. A crown of light was on the head of
the messenger of Heaven; glory was as a mantle
around him, and when he shook his silvery wings a
shower of stars seemed to fall upon earth. Fagir
trembled at the sight of the pure and holy being
who floated in the air before him without touching
the ground with his shining feet.</p>

<p>“O Fagir, thou art bidden to the banquet of Paradise!”
said the angel; and his voice was as music
at night. “Receive this white robe, in which, if it
retain its whiteness, thou mayst be meet to appear
in the presence of the great King. But beware of
sin; for every sin shall be as a stain on thy robe.
Keep it white for but <i>one day</i>, and all the joys of
Paradise shall be thine eternal reward.”</p>

<p>As the angel spake, he cast round the form of
Fagir a radiant robe, white as the snow on the
mountains. Then the angel touched the broad border
of the robe, and on the border appeared in letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of gold, <i>Fear God, and keep his commandments</i>
(Eccles. xii. 13). Fagir gazed in wonder on the
inscription; but even as he gazed it faded away.
He turned to look on the angel, but behold! the
bright messenger had vanished. Nothing remained
but the pure white robe, which Fagir still wore in
his dream.</p>

<p>Then the soul of Fagir was filled with hope and
triumph. “I have kept the commandments from
my youth!” he exclaimed; “and shall I break
them now, when my reward is so near at hand?
Only one day of trial, and then I shall be walking
in my radiant robe in the garden of celestial beauty,
and have for companions such beings as the bright
angel who left heaven to bear a message to me, the
upright and the pious.”</p>

<p>Then there came a change in the dream of Fagir:
he deemed that he had risen, as was his wont, at
sunrise, to go forth to the business of the day. His
thoughts were not now on Paradise, nor on the
message borne by the holy one; but still he wore
the mysterious robe which the angel had thrown
around him.</p>

<p>And on what were the thoughts of Fagir intent
as he took his early meal before starting for the
cutcherry, in which, as a government official, he
worked day after day? It might have been supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that one so pious would have reflected on
holy things, when the first rays of the morning sun
bade him thank God for sleep and protection during
the hours of darkness. But no; the thoughts of
Fagir were all on his worldly gains. He had for
years set his heart on buying a piece of land which
belonged to a neighbour of the name of Pir Bakhsh,
feeling certain that he could derive much profit from
its possession; but Pir Bakhsh had always refused
to sell the ground. But Fagir thought in his dream
that Pir Bakhsh had suddenly died in the night; his
heir was only a child, and Fagir rejoiced in the hope
that the land would now be sold, as the estate was
encumbered with debt.</p>

<p>“The piece of ground is worth four hundred
rupees<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> at least,” Fagir said to himself, “and I
shall manage now to buy it for two hundred rupees.
I shall then contrive to make the Magistrate Sahib
purchase it for a garden, as it lies so close to his
bungalow;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and a goodly sum he shall pay! I am
a less sharp fellow than I take myself to be, if,
before the year is over, my two hundred rupees have
not swelled into seven hundred rupees at the least.”</p>

<p>Fagir laughed to himself at the double profit
which he would make, first as purchaser, then as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
seller. But his mirth suddenly ceased when his
glance chanced to fall on his mysterious robe.</p>

<p>“I thought that this garment was whiter than
milk!” he exclaimed; “whence comes, then, this
dull gray tint upon it?” The answer to his question
came in an inscription which for a moment,
and only a moment, appeared on the border,—<i>The
love of money is the root of all evil</i> (1 Tim. vi. 10).</p>

<p>Fagir felt pained and surprised; he had often
heard the Christian padre<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> say that the religion of
the Lord Jesus reached even to the thoughts and
desires of the heart, but he had never till this time
clearly perceived that covetousness is sin in itself,
even if it lead to no open violation of the laws of
God or of man. As if hoping by prayer to restore
his robe to its former whiteness, Fagir now prostrated
himself on his carpet, and repeated a long
form of prayer. His lips moved, and a murmuring
sound of prayer was heard; but even while he
seemed to offer supplication and praise, the mind of
Fagir was still fixed on the coveted field: he was
thinking how he should persuade the orphan’s relatives
that the ground was of little value, and how
he should make the Sahib<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> regard it as worth at
least seven hundred rupees. Every time that Fagir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
repeated the name of God—and very often did he
utter the holy word in his prayer—there fell, as it
were, an ink-drop upon the garment given by the
angel. Suddenly Fagir perceived this, and started
up from his knees.</p>

<p>“Can I sin even in the act of prayer?” Fagir
exclaimed in dismay.</p>

<p>Then for an instant appeared on the border of the
robe the words uttered by the Almighty Himself,
amidst thunder and lightning, on Sinai,—<i>Thou shalt
not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for
the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his
name in vain</i> (Ex. xx. 7).</p>

<p>“I will think no more on this robe,” said Fagir,
with bitterness; “if my thoughts be tainted with
imperfection, my acts at least are blameless. It is
enough if a man live righteously; he is not master
of his own heart.” Here was at least an admission,
and that from one of the proudest of men, that the
heart has a root of bitterness in it that even the
most righteous of mortals have no power in themselves
to root up.</p>

<p>And now in the dream of Fagir it came to pass
that, as he was about to quit his dwelling, a messenger
arrived with a chit from Delhi. Fagir opened
and read it, and then, turning towards his wife, he
thus spake:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kasiti, this note brings good tidings. Hosein,
the head of my family, is coming from Delhi, and
will abide for ten days in this city. We must
receive him with great honour, for Hosein is a
wealthy and distinguished man, much esteemed in
the place where he dwells. There must be plentiful
feasting here during the days of his sojourn; I
will throw my doors wide open, and invite hundreds
of persons from far and near to meet my kinsman.”</p>

<p>Kasiti mildly made reply,—“Oh! my lord, your
salary is but one hundred and fifty rupees; whence,
then, will you spread the table for hundreds of
guests?”</p>

<p>“I will borrow what I need,” said Fagir.</p>

<p>“Oh! my lord,” said the gentle Kasiti, “the
padre hath said in my hearing, that debt is as a
chain, with which no servant of God should ever be
bound.”</p>

<p>“A woman’s best eloquence is silence!” exclaimed
Fagir with impatience. “Bring me the pen and
ink; I at once will write to the money-lender for
two hundred and fifty rupees; he will send the sum
without delay, for he knows that I am in government
employ.”</p>

<p>As Fagir stretched forth his hand for the pen, his
glance fell on the border of his stained garment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he read the words on it,—<i>Owe no man anything,
but to love one another</i> (Rom. xiii. 8).</p>

<p>It seemed as if Kasiti also had read the inscription,
for she ventured again to speak. “Were it
not well to welcome my lord’s kinsman with due
honour,” she said, “but with less of expense and
show? We have enough to enable us to show him
hospitality, not for ten days only, but for thrice ten,
if your guest be content to live as we live.”</p>

<p>“If Hosein should be content with so mean a
reception, <i>I</i> should not be content!” exclaimed
Fagir, his voice rising in wrath. “What! shall he
who is the head of ten villages come for the first
time under my roof, and find me living like a beggar?
Wouldst thou have me to be dishonoured in his eyes,
O thou ignorant and foolish woman? No! Hosein
shall return to Delhi and report to all his neighbours
that wealth and honour, much gold and many friends,
are the portion of his relative Fagir!”</p>

<p>It was then as if a dust-storm had swept over the
robe of Fagir: it darkened even as he spake; and
black on the edge of the garment he beheld the inscription,—<i>Pride
goeth before destruction, and a
haughty spirit before a fall</i> (Prov. xvi. 18).</p>

<p>Vexed with himself, and all the more so because
he saw tears in the eyes of Kasiti, Fagir quitted his
dwelling to go, as usual, to his work at the cutcherry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The words of his wife, though slighted,
rested on Fagir’s memory still: “Debt is a chain
with which no servant of God should ever be bound.”
It was a thing forbidden in the Bible! Fagir knew
that there was no necessity for him to incur debt;
it was pride alone, and thirst for the praise of men,
which made him submit to be bound like a slave
with the chain of debt.</p>

<p>“I shall soon cast it from me,” said Fagir to himself,
as he went on his way. “If I manage skilfully,
perhaps I may get that piece of land for even
less than two hundred rupees, for the friends of that
child know no more of business than I do of weaving
shawls. But I must make my bargain quickly,
or Mahmud, the man who ever crosses my path like
a snake, will be purchasing the land himself; I
know that he has for some time had his eye upon
it. He is a grasping, unscrupulous fellow, and his
presence to me is as the simoom to the traveller in
the desert. But lo! do I not behold him coming
towards me!”</p>

<p>Yes, it was Mahmud himself whom Fagir beheld
approaching him in his dream.</p>

<p>“Salám!”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> cried Mahmud; and Fagir respectfully
returned the greeting, wishing the man whom
he disliked health and all prosperity. The stain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
deceit and hypocrisy was on the garment worn by
Fagir.</p>

<p>“Have you heard of the sudden death of Pir
Bakhsh?” asked Mahmud, detaining Fagir, who was
about to pass on.</p>

<p>“I have heard of it,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I saw Pir Bakhsh but yesterday,” Mahmud went
on; “my good fortune led me to his house then, for
had I gone to-day I should have found him a corpse.
The poor fellow’s last act before his death was to
sell me that bit of land which lies close to the
Magistrate Sahib’s garden.”</p>

<p>The eyes of Mahmud glittered with satisfaction as
he spake; there was triumph in them, and in the
smile on his lips, which seemed to the enraged Fagir
to say, “I have forestalled thee and overreached
thee. I know that thy heart hath been set on that
piece of ground; it is now mine, and thou never
shalt have it, nor so much as set thy foot upon it!”</p>

<p>The two men parted without words of anger, but
the soul of Fagir was filled with disappointment,
envy, and anger. He clenched his hand, gnashed
his teeth, and, turning round, he looked after the
retiring form of Mahmud with a withering glance of
hatred.</p>

<p>“I detest that man,” muttered Fagir to himself;
then he started in horror, for behold red spots, as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
blood, were staining his once white robe, and in
blood-coloured letters on the border appeared the
inscription,—<i>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer;
and ye know that no murderer hath eternal
life</i> (1 John iii. 15).</p>

<p>Fagir now loathed his polluted garment, and
would fain have cast it from him, but he had no
power to do so; that which he had received from
the angel had become as a part of himself. That
robe was Fagir’s own boasted righteousness, and his
eyes had been opened to see that his righteousness
was but as <i>filthy rags</i> (Isa. lxiv. 6). But the eyes
may be opened without the heart being converted;
and thus it was with Fagir. The downfall of his
hopes regarding the piece of ground made him but
the more eager to make money in other ways, that
he might indulge his pride and ostentation.</p>

<p>Then, in his dream, Fagir found himself seated at
his desk in the cutcherry, with his piles of papers
before him. Amongst them was a chit<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> from the
Collector Sahib, and the contents of it were as follows:—</p>

<p>“There are two applicants for the office of under
clerk: the one, Patras, a Christian, has been highly
recommended to me; the other is Abbas, the son of
a wealthy merchant. I have desired them both to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
call upon you, that you may examine them as to
their qualifications for the office, as I have not myself
time to do so thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Not time, indeed! the Sahib might better have
said, not sufficient knowledge of the language and
the people,” muttered Fagir to himself, as he laid
down the chit. Then calling an attendant who was
outside, he said to him, “Is any one waiting to see
me?”</p>

<p>“A young man, of the name of Patras, has been
waiting your lordship’s pleasure for this last half-hour,”
answered the man.</p>

<p>“Let him enter,” said Fagir; and forthwith the
Christian entered, and made his respectful salám.</p>

<p>The head-clerk had no prejudice now against
Christians; on the contrary, Fagir was convinced
that they held the true faith, and that if they followed
the example of Him in whom they believed,
they would be the most upright and holy of men.
Fagir moreover knew something of Patras, and was
aware that he was one who had had to bear losses
for righteousness’ sake. With kindliness of manner
Fagir received the young man, and began, after the
customary salutation, to examine him as regarded
his knowledge of accounts and of other matters connected
with the work of the office. The replies of
Patras were all that could be desired; he was quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in answering, and made no mistakes. It was clear
to the mind of Fagir that here was a man who
would intelligently and faithfully fulfil the duties
of the office.</p>

<p>Yet there was something wanting in that young
man,—at least, in the judgment of the government
clerk. Though every answer given to his questions
was satisfactory, Fagir did not look satisfied yet.
Patras had knowledge in his head and wisdom on his
lips; but the young Christian had brought nothing
in his hand!</p>

<p>“I will see Abbas also before deciding on recommending
Patras to the Collector Sahib,” thought
Fagir. He dismissed the Christian from his presence;
and, hearing from the attendant that Abbas
was waiting at the entrance, Fagir gave permission
that he should appear before him.</p>

<p>Abbas was a contrast to Patras. The face of the
merchant’s son expressed cunning rather than talent;
his eyes avoided meeting those of Fagir; and when
questioned regarding accounts, the replies of Abbas
betrayed his imperfect knowledge of business. Fagir
saw that the young man had little to recommend
him, and was about to dismiss him, when Abbas
slowly, and as it were stealthily, drew forth a heavy
bag of rupees. There was no need for speaking a
word; this was not the first nor the second time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that Fagir—the self-righteous Fagir—had been offered
a bribe, and had not declined it!</p>

<p>Behold, O reader! how one sin draws on another,
even as do the divers links of a chain. With Fagir
pride led to extravagance, extravagance to debt, debt
to covetousness, covetousness to malice, meanness,
and dishonour. For shameful was the readiness of
Fagir, for the sake of money, to betray the confidence
reposed in him by his superior, to sacrifice the interests
of the public service, and to wrong a deserving
man. Fagir felt lowered in his own eyes as he took
the bag of rupees, and saw the words on the border
of his robe,—<i>He that walketh righteously, and
speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of
oppression, that shaketh his hand from holding of
bribes; ... he shall dwell on high</i> (Isa. xxxiii.
15, 16).</p>

<p>Then, in his dream, Fagir found himself standing
in the presence of the collector, who wished to hear
his opinion of the two candidates for the office of
under clerk.</p>

<p>“Have you examined the two men?” inquired
the English Sahib; and Fagir made reply,—</p>

<p>“I have done so, your honour.”</p>

<p>“I hope that Patras is the one best suited for the
situation,” said the collector; “for he has been highly
recommended to me as a perfectly trustworthy man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Patras may be a good man, Sahib,” replied
Fagir; “but he would make a very bad clerk. In
everything connected with work, I find him far
inferior to Abbas.”</p>

<p>“Then Abbas must have the place,” said the
Englishman; “the public interest must ever be considered
first of all.”</p>

<p>Fagir heard not the Sahib’s answer, for a feeling
of horror had stolen over the soul of the guilty clerk.
The robe which he wore had suddenly rent into rags
as he had spoken the words of falsehood, and in
letters of flame had appeared on the border,—<i>Lying
lips are an abomination unto the Lord</i> (Prov. xii.
22). <i>All liars shall have their part in the lake
which burneth with fire and brimstone</i> (Rev. xxi. 8).</p>

<p>And at that moment again Fagir beheld before
him the bright angel from whom he had received
the robe—that garment once so white, but now
stained, ragged, and polluted! The angel spake;
but the voice which had been sweeter than music
now sounded more terrible than the blast of the
trumpet of the archangel which shall call forth the
dead from their graves.</p>

<p>“O Fagir!” cried the angel, “thou art summoned
this moment to appear in the presence of the great
King.”</p>

<p>Then a horrible fear and dread seized upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
soul of him who had been so confident in his own
righteousness—of him who had said in his blindness
of heart, “I can hold my head erect before God and
man.” How should a poor wretch clad in loathsome
rags dare to appear before Him who is of purer eyes
than to behold iniquity; how should he venture
into the presence of the terrible King! Fagir felt
as if he would rather call on the rocks and the mountains
to hide him; and, in his agony, he cried out
so loudly, “God be merciful to me, a sinner!” that
he awoke from his dream. And, behold, he was
reclining on cushions, with his hookah beside him,
the punkah swinging to and fro, and Kasiti, with
her Bible still on her knees, sitting at his feet.</p>

<p>“My lord<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> has had troubled sleep,” said the wife,
raising her mild eyes from her book.</p>

<p>“O Kasiti!” exclaimed Fagir, still trembling from
the effects of his dream; “how can a poor sinner,
such as I am, weak, guilty, and full of evil, become
fit to appear before God?”</p>

<p>Kasiti glanced down again at her Bible, and read
aloud the prayer of the penitent David from the
page which lay open before her,—<i>Purge me with
hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
be whiter than snow. Create in me a clean heart,
O God; and renew a right spirit within me</i>
(Ps. li. 7, 10).</p>

<p>“Can those who have stained the garments of the
soul ever renew their whiteness?” exclaimed Fagir.</p>

<p>Kasiti knew not how to reply to her husband in
words of her own; but she turned over the leaves
of her Bible till she came to the description of the
blessed in heaven, and then silently pointed to the
words of the angel: <i>These are they which have
come out of great tribulation, and have washed their
robes, and made them white in the blood of the
Lamb</i> (Rev. vii. 14).</p>

<p>Fagir prostrated himself before the Lord in deep
humility of soul. Having discovered that he was a
great sinner, he now felt his need of a great Saviour.
Having seen that his own righteousness was as filthy
rags, he desired that his soul might be washed clean
in the blood of the Lamb of God which taketh away
the sin of the world. Fagir soon afterwards sought
baptism; but not only the outward sign, the water
upon the brow, but the inward baptism of the Holy
Ghost, the Spirit which toucheth the heart.</p>

<p>Having received free pardon and found mercy
through Christ, Fagir thenceforth manfully struggled
against the world, the flesh, and the devil. He
strove to put away sin—the proud heart, the covetous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
desire, malice, hatred, and all uncharitableness.
Fagir became one who shaketh his hand from holding
of bribes, and keepeth his tongue as with a
bridle. All who knew him said of Fagir, “Behold
one who walketh uprightly.” But Fagir himself
never ceased every day to utter the prayer,—<i>God
be merciful to me, a sinner.</i></p>

<span class="smaller">The Church which Grew out of One Brick.</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Gunga Ram, Ya’kub, and Isa Das were
three poor ryots<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who lived by their
daily toil, and earned scarcely more than
enough to supply their families with the bare necessaries
of life. These men were neighbours and
friends; they had heard at the same time the gospel
preached by the good Pastor Ghopal; on the same
day they had received baptism from his hand, and professed
their faith in Christ as the Lord. Wherever one
of these ryots was seen, it was certain that the other
two would not be far distant. And yet, though the
three were all Christians in name, toiled in the same
field, and led the same kind of life, He who readeth
the heart saw as much difference between them as
between the diamond which shines in a rajah’s diadem
and the pebble which the coolie tramples under foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning Gunga Ram, Ya’kub, and Isa Das,
on their way to the rice-field, passed close to the
spot on which their pastor, Ghopal, by the aid of
the Sahib Log, had been building a church. Money
had come from praying people in England, and
brick by brick the church had risen, until only the
roof was wanting. Then there came heavy rains,
and the river swelled and rose, and overflowed its
banks. The storm beat against the unfinished
building, and the labour of months was swept away
in a day. The rain ceased, the river flowed again
in its usual channel; but where a goodly church
had been rising, alas, there were now but ruins!</p>

<p>Gunga Ram, Ya’kub, and Isa Das stood gazing
upon these ruins, sorrowful to see the destruction
wrought by the flood.</p>

<p>“The heart of the Padre Ghopal will be exceeding
sad,” said Isa Das. “It was his joy day by
day to see his church rising, and to think of the
time when he should gather in it his people, as a
shepherd gathers his flock.”</p>

<p>“He will build up the church again, and build it
more strongly,” said Ya’kub.</p>

<p>“Alas! my friend, where shall the money come
from?” cried Isa Das. “I heard Padre Ghopal say
but yesterday, with tears in his eyes, that he fears
that he can get no more rupees from England. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Collector Sahib, who gave thirty gold mohurs, has
gone from the station; and Manton Sahib, who fills
his place, has refused to give even a pice.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>“Manton Sahib is very stingy!” cried Ya’kub.
“He has a grand bungalow, fine carriages and
horses, and feasts like a prince; he could give many
gold mohurs and not miss them. Why does he not
help to build up our church?”</p>

<p>“Manton Sahib told Padre Ghopal that the people
should build one for themselves,” Isa Das made reply.</p>

<p>Then his two companions shook their heads, and
said bitter things against the Sahib who cared not
to help in such a good work.</p>

<p>“How can we who are so poor build a church?”
exclaimed Ya’kub. “We live in small huts, and
seldom eat anything better than rice and fruit. I
have really not enjoyed one good satisfying meal
since the marriage of my younger brother, two years
ago.” Ya’kub sighed at the remembrance of that
great feast—the rich dishes, the pastry, and the
sweetmeats; for a feast was to Ya’kub the greatest
of joys, and he knew not when he should taste such
another again.</p>

<p>“If I were a rich baboo,” said Gunga Ram, “I
would give a thousand rupees to Pastor Ghopal for
his church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I were a great rajah,” cried Ya’kub, “I would
build a church all by myself, and make it as grand
as the Taj!”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>“I shall never be either baboo or rajah,” said Isa
Das thoughtfully; “but though I am only a poor
ryot, I should like to put one brick in that church;”
and he looked, as he spoke, at the ruins.</p>

<p>“What is thy meaning?” asked his companions.</p>

<p>“O my brothers,” replied Isa Das, “did not the
Pastor Ghopal preach yesterday on the words of the
Lord Jesus: <i>It is more blessed to give than to
receive</i> (Acts xx. 35). When I heard him I said
in my heart, ‘Is that blessing kept for the rich;
shall not the poor give something also?’”</p>

<p>“They cannot give,” cried Gunga Ram, to whom
his pice were dear as the drops of blood in his
veins.</p>

<p>But Isa Das did not appear persuaded of the
truth of these words. “Do you not remember,”
said he, “how, when the Lord Christ stood in the
Temple, and saw rich men casting into the treasury
of God much gold and much silver, and then a poor
widow casting in two mites, He said to His disciples,
‘This poor widow hath cast in more than they all’
(Luke xxi. 3). The Lord accepted the offering of
her who had little to give, but gave from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
heart. I should like to put one brick in that
church!”</p>

<p>And before Isa Das left the spot with his two
companions, his wish had formed itself into a silent
prayer. “O Lord, Thou hast said it is more blessed
to give than to receive; help me to win that blessing.
Thou dost love the offering of the poor; show
me the way to offer something to Thee!”</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The three men, Gunga Ram, Ya’kub, and Isa Das,
soon reached their place of labour,—a rice-field
which bordered on a great river. On the other side
of the broad waters they could see the bungalow to
which Manton Sahib had come but the week before.
It was a large well-built bungalow with white
pillars, and was partly hidden by the mango-trees
and the tall palm-trees which grew in the compound
around it.</p>

<p>“See!” cried Gunga Ram, pointing towards the
river; “there is some one on horseback trying to
cross the waters.”</p>

<p>“It is a stranger; he knows not the ford,” said
Isa Das.</p>

<p>“If he wish not to be carried away by the
stream,” observed Ya’kub, “he must turn his horse’s
head more to the right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Isa Das lifted up his voice and shouted, “To the
right—to the right!” Perhaps the stranger did
not hear him; or hearing, paid no heed to the warning
of a poor ryot.</p>

<p>“It is Manton Sahib himself,” exclaimed Gunga
Ram; “I know him by the red beard and long
hair.”</p>

<p>“He will be drowned,” said Ya’kub. “See! his
horse has lost his footing already, and is plunging
madly into the midst of the foaming waters. The
Sahib will be carried away by the current, and
drowned!”</p>

<p>“Let us hasten to his help!” cried Isa Das;
“we know the ford well, and could find it even on
a starless night.”</p>

<p>“And we can swim like ducks,” added Ya’kub.</p>

<p>“If we save the Sahib, we shall have a great
reward!” cried Gunga Ram, as he eagerly hurried
after Isa Das, who had already plunged into the
swollen river.</p>

<p>All the three men battled with the waters; all
three hastened to save a drowning man; all three
risked their lives to do so. The act was the same,
but the motive different. Gunga Ram thought of
praise and reward; Isa Das thought but of the
words of the Lord—“Inasmuch as ye did it, ye did
it unto me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the three ryots could reach the spot where
the horse had lost his footing, the commissioner was
almost drowned. The rush of waters had borne
him out of his saddle; only one of his feet was yet
in the stirrup; the rein had escaped from his hand;
he was clinging for life to the mane of the struggling
horse, of which only the head could be seen
above the torrent. The Sahib had scarcely even
power to shout for help; but in his great need
help was at hand. Ya’kub seized the rein of the
horse; Gunga Ram gave his powerful aid; while
Isa Das supported the half-drowned man, and
assisted him to recover his seat in the saddle.
With violent efforts, and with both difficulty and
risk, the three ryots succeeded in bringing both
the horse and his gasping rider safe back to the
side of the river.</p>

<p>As the horse struggled up the bank, with clotted
mane and streaming flanks, Manton Sahib uttered a
few words which were not addressed to the ryots,
and which they could not understand. Isa Das
thought, and perhaps thought rightly, that the
Englishman, in his own language, was thanking God
for preservation from death. The Sahib shook the
drops from his dripping hair; his solah topee was
floating far away down the river; he had lost it
in the desperate struggle for life. Manton patted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the neck of his trembling horse; then turning
towards the ryots, addressed them in their own
tongue,—</p>

<p>“Brave men; you have done a good service, and
shall not miss a reward. Follow me to my own
house.”</p>

<p>“As your highness commands,” replied the three
ryots at once.</p>

<p>“This is a fortunate day for us,” exclaimed
Gunga Ram, as the three men followed the commissioner
towards his handsome bungalow; “we shall
be poor ryots no longer; we shall no more have to
earn our rice by the sweat of our brows.”</p>

<p>“We will eat something better than rice,” cried
the feast-loving Ya’kub. “In hopes of good food, I
seem already to feel myself growing fat as a baboo!”
and he patted his breast.</p>

<p>When the commissioner reached his house, he
called aloud for his bearer, and gave command that
money should be brought. A bag of silver was
quickly placed in the Sahib’s hand; and before he
dismounted from his horse, Manton drew from it
three rupees, and gave one to each of the men.</p>

<p>The ryots made low saláms as they took the
pieces of silver, and then together they turned from
the commissioner’s house. But the worm of discontent
gnawed at the heart of Gunga Ram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does the Sahib value his life but at three
rupees?” he muttered. “One rupee is not worth
the wetting of my waist-cloth!”</p>

<p>Ya’kub laughed at the disappointment of his companion.
“One rupee will at least buy a right good
dinner!” said he. “No work to-day for me. I
will hasten off to the bazaar, and have once more
such a feast as that of which I partook when my
younger brother was married.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thou man without wisdom!” cried Gunga
Ram, as he tied up his piece of silver in the end of
his waist-cloth; “thou wilt not surely spend all thy
rupee on one meal?”</p>

<p>But Ya’kub was already beyond hearing of the
voice of his friend. It was as if the savoury fragrance
of the coming feast were drawing Ya’kub on
from afar. He hastened his steps, even as the thirsty
camel doth in the desert when he smelleth water,
and rusheth towards the well.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt not spend thy money thus?” asked
Gunga Ram of Isa Das.</p>

<p>Isa Das smiled as he made reply: “No; I will
not thus spend my rupee upon feasting;” and he
thought, but he spake not his thought aloud,—“The
Lord hath already heard and answered my prayer.
I, even I, a poor ryot, will put one brick in that
church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>On the evening of that same day, Padre Ghopal
and the English padre, Logan by name, walked together
to look upon the ruins of the native church
that had been destroyed by the flood. Ghopal, with
tears in his eyes, as he stood by the ruins, besought
the Padre Sahib to help him in this great trouble, as
he had often helped him before.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, very sorry, for the destruction of
your church,” said Logan Sahib kindly but gravely;
“but I really cannot so soon again ask for subscriptions
from England, and my own purse is now
empty. There was a collection made for you but
last year in my former parish, near London, and some
of the very poorest of the school children gave to it
their pence and their halfpence, instead of spending
the money on sweetmeats. I heard of a blind
woman who, day by day, can scarcely earn her
scanty living by knitting, who yet found that she
could spare something to help the Lord’s work in
a distant land. If she cared for the building of a
church into which she never will enter, and for the
conversion to God of people whom she never will
see, are the members of your flock content to remain
idle? Do they think it well to sit with folded
hands like children, and expect to be fed by others?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
It is time that native Christians should learn the
proverb, ‘God helps those that help themselves.’”</p>

<p>Padre Ghopal shook his head and sighed deeply.
“I have spoken to the people on this subject again
and again,” he replied, “but they listen as those
who hear not. They are as trees that bear leaves
of profession, but the fruit of good works is not seen
on the boughs. Besides, my people are poor,” added
the native pastor.</p>

<p>“Was it not said of the Philippians, how their
deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their
liberality, for that to their power, yea, and beyond
their power, they were willing of themselves?”
(2 Cor. viii. 2) said Padre Logan. “Not till we see
more of this spirit of liberality and self-sacrifice in
the Indian Church, will God’s full blessing rest upon
it.”</p>

<p>“I know it, I know it,” sighed Padre Ghopal.</p>

<p>“And not all your people are poor,” continued
the English pastor. “You have amongst them
baboos in government employ, who receive good
salaries every month. Can you not persuade them
to give at least one-tenth of their means to the Giver
of all, even as every Jew did in the days of old?
Shall Christians do less for their religion than did
the Jews?”</p>

<p>“The baboos want good houses, and their wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
want fine jewels,” said Padre Ghopal. “If we
wait to rebuild this church till the people bring
free-will offerings, like Jews at Jerusalem or Christians
at Philippi, we shall wait till yon river runs
dry.”</p>

<p>Even as Padre Ghopal spoke, a poor ryot drew
nigh, and respectfully made his salám. “May I
speak with the padre?” said he.</p>

<p>“He has, of course, some favour to ask,” observed
Padre Logan. “These people are always crying,
‘Give—give!’”</p>

<p>Isa Das, for it was he, heard the words of the
Englishman, and they were bitter to the soul of the
ryot; but without looking towards him the poor
man turned to his own pastor and silently held out
his hand, in which there was one bright silver
rupee.</p>

<p>“What is thy meaning? What wouldst thou
have me do with this rupee?” asked Padre Ghopal
in surprise as he took the money.</p>

<p>Isa Das pointed with his finger to the ruins and
said, “I should like to put one brick into that
church.”</p>

<p>“This is strange—very strange!” exclaimed
Padre Logan. “I never heard of anything like it
in this country before. How can such a man, lean
in body, and wearing but one garment, have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
whole rupee to spare?” and he glanced with suspicion
at Isa Das, for he thought to himself,—“That
man must have stolen the piece of silver.”</p>

<p>“Let not my lord have hard thoughts of his
servant,” said Isa Das, who understood the look.
“Your servant to-day helped Gunga Ram and Ya’kub
to save the life of Manton Sahib when he had missed
the ford, and was nearly drowned in the river.
Manton Sahib for that service gave to each of us a
rupee.”</p>

<p>“And you devote yours to the building of your
church!” exclaimed Padre Logan.</p>

<p>“I give it to the Lord, who loved and gave Himself
for me,” was Isa Das’s reply, as with a cheerful,
happy heart he turned from the place.</p>

<p>Padre Logan watched the poor man as he departed,
then suddenly shook Ghopal by the hand.
“God forgive me for my harsh judgment!” he cried;
“and God be praised that there are men in India
like this poor ryot!”</p>

<p>A ray of pleasure and hope brightened the face of
Padre Ghopal. “I will once more visit the baboos,”
he said, “and see if the example of this poor man
will not move them to give of their abundance, even
as he hath given of his poverty. But first let us
together beseech the Lord to open the hearts of the
people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Was Isa Das a poorer man on account of what he
had given to God? No one would have thought so,
who could have seen with what a light step and happy
face he returned to his home that evening. The rich
flower of joy grows on the prickly shrub of self-denial;
the flower blooms even in this world, but
the fruit will be gathered in the next. As Isa Das
passed along the dusty road which led to his hut,
everything on which he looked seemed to add to his
joy. There was the golden light of sunset; Isa Das
beheld it, and said to himself, “Light is the gift of
God.” He passed where the thirsty cattle were
drinking at the river, and said to himself, “Water
is the gift of God.” Isa Das remembered his own
blessings, and said to himself,—“Eyes to see, and
ears to hear, and hands to work, and feet to walk,—these
also are gifts of God. The great Father in
heaven loves to give. He gave His only-begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not
perish, but have everlasting life (John iii. 16). God
hath called us to be His children; and shall not the
children be even as the Father, and also delight in
giving? Yea, to give freely and to give joyfully,—this
is the right of the children of God.”</p>

<p>When Isa Das came in sight of his humble home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
his little boy, his well-beloved, ran forth to meet
him. The child had a flower in his hand,—a small
flower which he had plucked to give to his father.
Isa Das caught up the child and kissed him, and
took the small flower from the little hand with a
smile of acceptance, as if it had been the Koh-i-noor
worn by the Queen. “My loving child,—he also is
a gift from God,” thought the ryot.</p>

<p>When Isa Das entered his humble home, he found
that his wife had carefully prepared the evening
meal. It was but a very simple meal, but Isa Das
blessed God before he ate it as thankfully as if he
had been sitting down to a feast. Then he told his
wife of all that had happened; for Isa Das was the
Christian husband of a Christian woman, and they
shared all each other’s sorrows and joys, and nothing
that the one did was ever hidden from the other.
The love which Isa Das and his Lakhdili felt for
each other was also the gift of God.</p>

<p>When the wife heard of the gift of the rupee, her
eyes sparkled with pleasure, for she thought,—“My
husband will perhaps buy a new chaddar for me, or
bangles to put on the arms of our dear little boy;”
but when Isa Das told Lakhdili that his money had
gone to be, as it were, a brick in the church, she
was too good a wife and too good a woman to say
aught against what her husband had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, husband! thou hast done a good work,”
said Lakhdili; “and good works are the ladder by
which holy men, as thou art, climb to heaven.”</p>

<p>“Oh, woman!” cried Isa Das with earnestness,
“thinkest thou that by good works we poor sinners
can climb to heaven? As well might I gather a
heap of date-stones together, and think by mounting
on them to reach the noonday sun! Heaven is
Christ’s free gift; He bought it for us with His own
blood. But we love Him who gave us the gift,—we
love Him as my little child loves me,—and our
offerings are even as this flower which my darling
gathered to place in the hand of his father.”</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Scarcely had Isa Das finished his meal, when
some one approached him. The light of sunset had
faded away, and Isa Das could not see the face of
him who had come, but when he spoke Isa Das
knew well the voice of Gunga Ram.</p>

<p>“Dost thou know what hath befallen our companion
Ya’kub?” were the first words of Gunga
Ram as he seated himself on the ground near Isa
Das.</p>

<p>“I have not seen Ya’kub since the morning,” was
Isa Das’s reply, “when from Manton Sahib we each
received a rupee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, poor Ya’kub!” cried Gunga Ram, but more
in mirth than in sorrow. “Did I not warn him
and say to him, ‘Thou man without wisdom, spend
not all thy money upon one meal!’ His bright
rupee has been to him even as a melon under which
a centipede lies hidden, that bites the hand of him
who gathers the fruit.”</p>

<p>“What is thy meaning?” asked Isa Das.</p>

<p>“Ya’kub hurried off to the bazaar,” Gunga Ram
made answer; “and there, to the last pie, he spent
his money on buying dainties, the fat and the sweet.
And he bought bang also, and he ate to the full, and
he drank to the full, till his eyes would not have
distinguished the saddle of a horse from the hump of
a bullock!”</p>

<p>“Alas, that Ya’kub should thus have cast disgrace
on the Christian name!” exclaimed Isa Das with
sorrow.</p>

<p>But Gunga Ram neither showed nor felt any regret
at the fall of his weaker brother; it was to him
rather a cause of mirth.</p>

<p>“Ya’kub became in his drunkenness as one who
is mad,” thus Gunga Ram went on with his story.
“Ya’kub ran against the bearers of a palki,—rushing
fiercely against them as the wild boar rushes
through the jungle,—and, behold! in the palki was
the Manton Sahib himself!” Gunga Ram laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
till his sides shook as he added, “So poor Ya’kub,
of course, was sent to jail. This was the end of his
feast! This was the great good which came to him
from the rupee given by the Sahib!”</p>

<p>Then Isa Das could not help thinking of the
words of the wise Solomon written in the Holy
Book,—“The blessing of the Lord it maketh rich,
and He addeth no sorrow with it” (Prov. x. 22).
Poor Ya’kub had sought no blessing; he had cared
but to gratify the lusts of the flesh; and behold sorrow
and disgrace had come where he had looked for
nothing but joy.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt not thus spend thy rupee, my friend?”
he said unto Gunga Ram.</p>

<p>“Spend it, indeed! Why should I spend it at all?”
was Gunga Ram’s reply. “No; I do not lightly
part with my money,—I gather it up and store it.
A pice is but a little coin, but many pice make a
rupee, and many rupees a gold mohur; and as the
proverb saith truly,—‘By patience the mulberry-leaf
becomes satin.’” Gunga Ram lowered his voice
and glanced round him suspiciously as he went
on,—“Why should I hide a secret from thee which
I have already confided to Ya’kub? The Sahib’s
coin lies not alone in my bag,—there are now thrice
three, which I have saved by care and self-denial;
and if things go well with me to the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
year, I shall have as many rupees saved as I have
fingers on these two hands;” and Gunga Ram
stretched out his hands as he spoke.</p>

<p>“What avails our having money, if we never
spend it?” asked Isa Das. “Hast thou never
heard the words of the Lord: ‘Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and
steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and
where thieves do not break through nor steal’?”
(Matt. vi. 19, 20).</p>

<p>Gunga Ram gave a sign of impatience. “Preach
not to me, but look to thyself!” he exclaimed. “I
wot thou hast not yet parted thyself with the
Sahib’s rupee.”</p>

<p>“I have parted with it,” replied Isa Das with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Hast thou then been to the bazaar and bought
a ring, or a bracelet, or a new kamarband?” asked
Gunga Ram.</p>

<p>Isa Das shook his head.</p>

<p>“Or a goat to give milk to thy child?”</p>

<p>Again Isa Das shook his head as he made reply,—“I
have bought nothing, O my friend!”</p>

<p>“Then thou hast lost thy rupee?” cried Gunga
Ram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have not lost it,” said Isa Das with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“Thou hast not kept, nor spent, nor lost it; then
hast thou been so mad as to give it away to some
poor neighbour?” asked Gunga Ram, who would
not so much as have given away an anna to his
own brother.</p>

<p>“I have given it to One who is rich,” replied Isa
Das; and he added to himself,—“to One who for
our sakes was yet content to be poor.”</p>

<p>“If thou hast given thy good rupee to one who
is rich already, thou hast indeed acted the part of a
fool!—unless, indeed, he be likely to repay thee thy
money with interest,” said Gunga Ram.</p>

<p>“A hundredfold—a thousandfold,” thought Isa
Das, as he lifted up his eyes towards heaven. “It
is there that I would lay up my treasure.”</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>On the following evening there was a great dinner
at the bungalow of Manton Sahib. All the English
gentlemen of the station were invited, and amongst
them came Padre Logan.</p>

<p>There was much talk at the dinner-table on
various matters,—the last news from Europe, the
state of the crops, the movements of the governor-general,
and the chance of a war in Burmah. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
last Padre Logan observed to Manton Sahib, to whom
he sat opposite, “I hear that yesterday you had a
narrow escape from drowning.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Manton Sahib; “I missed the
ford when attempting to cross the river, lost my
seat in the saddle, and never in all my life felt myself
nearer to death than I did when the waters
came rushing around me, for I am unable to swim.
I believe that I should not have been sitting at this
table to-day, had not three ryots, capital swimmers,
come to my rescue.”</p>

<p>“And you gave each of them a rupee,” observed
Padre Logan.</p>

<p>“Unlucky rupees they were,” cried the commissioner,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“How so?” inquired Padre Logan, whilst the
rest of the company at table became silent in order
to listen.</p>

<p>“Why, before the day was over, one of the
fellows got drunk on his rupee,” replied Manton
Sahib. “He actually attacked my bearers with a
stick when I was going home in my palki in the
evening, and was so noisy and troublesome that I
was obliged to send him to prison.”</p>

<p>“But another of the ryots made a very different
use of his rupee,” observed Padre Logan.</p>

<p>“That is to say, he made no use of it at all,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
replied the commissioner. “But the very circumstance
of his having the money brought the poor
fellow to grief.”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked Colonel Miller, an officer who
sat at the end of the table.</p>

<p>“A rumour had been abroad,” thus Manton Sahib
made reply, “that week after week, and month
after month, this ryot, whose name is Gunga Ram,
has been saving money, pie by pie. But no one
was sure of the matter, for the man’s earnings were
so small that it was hard to believe that he should
be able to scrape any money together. But it appears
that Ya’kub, in his drunkenness, had made
it known throughout the bazaar that Gunga Ram,
like himself, had received a present from me; and
perhaps rumour had turned the one rupee into
ten.”</p>

<p>“That is likely enough,” said Padre Logan.</p>

<p>“Be that as it may, poor Gunga Ram had to pay
dearly for his love of money,” said Manton Sahib.
“About midnight some thieves entered his hut, and
searched it, but at first could find nothing in it.
Determined to reach the supposed hoard, the villains
seized poor Gunga Ram, and cruelly tortured him to
make him confess where he had buried his money.
In his agony the poor wretch told them the place.
The cries of Gunga Ram reached the ears of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the police, who came to his aid; but before they
entered the hut the thieves had made off with the
money, and the police found only the miserable
Gunga Ram stretched on the ground bleeding and
groaning. He was carried off to the hospital at
once. Thus you see that I had some cause to say
that mine were unlucky rupees.”</p>

<p>“You have told us of the fate of two of the receivers
of your gift,” observed the English padre;
“let me now tell you something of the third ryot,
and of the use which he made of his rupee, which
may perhaps be to you yet more surprising.”</p>

<p>“One of the fellows is lodged in an hospital, another
in a jail,” said Colonel Miller, laughing; “I
suppose that the story of the third will be that he
bought a rope with his rupee, and hanged himself
in the next mango-grove.”</p>

<p>Most of the rest of the company laughed; but
Manton Sahib turned attentively to listen to what
Padre Logan was going to say. “What did the
third man do with his money?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“He gave it to Padre Ghopal, to help to rebuild
the little native church that was thrown down by
the flood,” was the padre’s reply.</p>

<p>All the company looked surprised. No one had
been surprised to hear of a man getting drunk on
bang, or of another being tortured and robbed; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
they regarded the poor ryot’s free-will offering to
God as a very strange thing indeed.</p>

<p>“I can scarcely believe it,” said Colonel Miller;
and his face expressed doubt yet more than did
his words.</p>

<p>“I was myself present when Isa Das gave his
rupee into the hand of Ghopal,” said the English
padre.</p>

<p>“Then I can only say that this ryot gives me a
higher opinion of the natives of India than I ever
had before,” observed Colonel Miller.</p>

<p>“You see, sir,” said Logan, addressing himself to
Manton Sahib, “that not all of the rupees went to
the thieves or to the seller of bang.”</p>

<p>Manton Sahib was silent for some moments, reflecting
deeply. At the time of his preservation
from drowning he had thanked God for saving him
from death, but never till he heard of the gift of the
poor ryot had he thought of bringing a thank-offering,
an acknowledgment of the mercy shown to
him by God. The poor man’s piety kindled a feeling
of piety in the breast of the wealthy Sahib,
even as one torch is kindled by another.</p>

<p>“Are the natives, then, so anxious to have their
church built?” the commissioner asked of the
clergyman.</p>

<p>“Many wish it to be built,” was Padre Logan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
reply; “but Isa Das is the only one of whom I
have yet heard as helping the cause by a gift.”</p>

<p>“Then let his example be followed,” cried Manton
Sahib; “and my help shall not be wanting.
Tell Ghopal, that whatever sum of money he may
succeed in gathering from his native flock for the
building of the church before Sunday next, shall be
doubled by me.”</p>

<p>“Ghopal will not gather much, I suspect,” observed
Colonel Miller to Manton Sahib; “your
purse will not be greatly lightened.”</p>

<p>“Whether the sum be small or great, I will keep
to my promise,” said the commissioner; “and the
heavier the drain on my purse, the better shall I be
pleased.”</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Before the rising of the sun on the following morning,
Padre Logan was on his way to the house of
Ghopal, to carry to him the news of the commissioner’s
promise. Before the sun had set on that
day, Padre Ghopal had visited the dwelling of every
native Christian in the place, and in every house
had told of the poor ryot’s offering, and of the rich
commissioner’s offer. Never had such interest and
excitement been shown amongst the Christians before.
The punishment of Ya’kub, the erring one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and the robbery of the money of the unfortunate
Gunga Ram, were known to all; and the story of
the three rupees from the lips of Padre Ghopal fell
with more effect upon the ears of the hearers than
ten sermons might have done. “God is great!”
they exclaimed. “Happy is he upon whom rests
the blessing of the Most High. Without that
blessing, even money may bring but sorrow and
shame.”</p>

<p>Padre Ghopal carried with him a bag to receive
the contributions of the people. When he started
in the morning, there was but one rupee in the bag—that
one was the offering of Isa Das; but before
Ghopal returned to his home the bag had become
a heavy burden, full of pice, annas, and rupees.
Those who had never given before now gave with
thankfulness and joy.</p>

<p>“I was going to spend much on the marriage
festivities of my daughter,” said one; “I will spend
less on feasting and show, that I may have something
to spare for the work of God. May the Lord
Jesus grant His favour to my child; that is far
better than dance or feasting could be.”</p>

<p>“I had intended to buy a new horse,” said a
baboo; “but I will make my old pony carry me
yet another year. I will ride him with pleasure;
and mounted upon him, will go from day to day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
see the house of God rising from its ruins, for I shall
have put many bricks in that church.”</p>

<p>Margam, the mother of Padre Ghopal, had no
money to give; but, with a happy smile, she drew
from her arm a silver bangle, and dropped it into
the bag of her son. “Let the silver be changed
into bricks for the house of the Lord,” said the
pious woman.</p>

<p>Before the appointed Sunday arrived, Padre Logan
and Ghopal together, with thankful surprise, counted
out the money which had been poured by rich and
poor into the treasury of the Lord. The coppers and
the silver together, and cowries also, that were found
in the bag, amounted to a goodly sum; and when the
last rupee had been counted, Padre Ghopal lifted up
his eyes to heaven, and exclaimed, “God be praised!
He hath answered our prayers even beyond our
hopes. There is lying before me in these heaps
half of the money required to build up our church!”</p>

<p>“And Manton Sahib will double the amount,”
said the joyful Padre Logan. “He is a man who
will never flinch back from keeping his promise.”</p>

<p>Padre Logan was right; nor had the commissioner
the slightest wish to flinch back from keeping
his promise. Manton Sahib rejoiced to help those
who were helping themselves. Never had the Englishman
written anything with more pleasure than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
when he dipped his pen and made out a cheque on
the Bank of Bengal for the remainder of the sum
required to complete the building of the church.</p>

<p>Fast went on the work of building; the church
seemed to grow rapidly, as rice when the water rises
around it. Every one in the Christian village rejoiced
to see its progress, and many who could give
no money gave a helping hand to the work.</p>

<p>“This is our own church,” the people would say;
“we need no more money from England. We ourselves,
with the Commissioner Sahib’s help, have
built our house of prayer, and we will support our
minister also. It is a good thing to offer freely and
joyfully to the Lord. ‘God loveth a cheerful giver’”
(2 Cor. ix. 7).</p>

<p>Before the rainy season arrived the little church
was built and roofed in; and there was a glad
gathering of all the people to celebrate the opening
of the holy house with prayer and songs of praise.
Gunga Ram and Ya’kub were there; the one had
left his hospital, the other had been dismissed from
jail. Gunga Ram had a pale cheek, and a deep scar
left by a wound; and poor Ya’kub could scarcely
lift his eyes from the ground, for shame covered his
face. These two poor ryots joined in the prayer,
but their voices were not heard in the songs of joy.</p>

<p>After the meeting was over, Gunga Ram and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Ya’kub joined Isa Das, who was standing a little
apart, his hands clasped, his face bright with happiness,
as he looked at the beautiful building standing
where only ruins had been.</p>

<p>“Ah, my brother!” cried Gunga Ram, “this is indeed
a day of rejoicing for thee. Behold God hath heard
thy prayer, and hath greatly prospered thy work.”</p>

<p>Gunga Ram spoke from the heart, for during the
time of his sore sickness and pain God’s Holy Spirit
had spoken to his soul. Gunga Ram had resolved
that out of his little earnings a tenth part should
always henceforth be devoted to holy uses, the support
of his pastor, and the relief of the poor. Gunga
Ram would seek to lay up for himself treasure in
heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
nor thieves break through and steal.</p>

<p>“I am as joyous as if I were sultan of the world,”
said Isa Das, “when I look on that house, in which
I hope that the gospel will be preached from generation
to generation.”</p>

<p>“And thou thyself hath built that church,” said
Gunga Ram.</p>

<p>“I build a church!—I, who am but a poor ryot!”
exclaimed Isa Das in surprise. “Thou dost not
well, O Gunga Ram, to speak words of mockery to
thy friend.”</p>

<p>“They are not words of mockery, but words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
truth,” replied Gunga Ram. “Without thy prayers
and thy offering, that church would not have been
standing there this day. It is thou who didst build
that church.”</p>

<p>“I laid but one brick,” said Isa Das.</p>

<p>“But as from the seed springs the tree, so from
that one brick laid in faith and prayer that goodly
building hath risen,” said Gunga Ram. “O my
brother, I have learned a great lesson whilst lying
wounded and in sore trouble,—a lesson which is
worth more to me than the nine rupees which the
robbers carried away. Our money is as seed-corn
which the Lord, the great Land-owner, commits to
His servants that they may sow and reap a hundredfold.
Ya’kub was as one who grinds the seed-corn
and eats it, and lo, his field is brown and bare when
the green blade is springing up in the fields of others
around him! I was as one who hides his seed-corn
till the time for sowing is past, and that which
might have brought forth good fruit becomes corrupted
and mouldy. But thou, O Isa Das, thou
hast been as one who does the bidding of his lord,
and in the day of harvest greatly rejoices. For is
it not written in the Word of Truth, <i>He that soweth
to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption;
but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit
reap life everlasting</i>?” (Gal. vi. 8.)</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It was a happy day for Hassan, the Christian
moonshee,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> when all arrangements
were settled for the marriage of his
daughter Fatima with Yuhanna, a highly respectable
baboo,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> who held the same faith as himself.
Hassan had had a time of great trouble both before
and after his baptism; old friends had turned their
back upon him, and those who had often eaten his
bread had crossed to the other side of the road when
they saw him. Reproach had been cast upon his
name, and sharp words had pierced his soul like a
sword. Yet Hassan had held fast to the faith
which he had embraced; he had borne losses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
endured reproach, strengthened by prayer,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and
helped by the counsels of Alton Sahib, the English
friend who had first placed a Bible in the hands of
his moonshee. The storm of persecution had now
passed over; men ceased to revile one whom they
could not but respect; Hassan earned a comfortable
livelihood by teaching; and now his daughter’s
betrothal to the baboo whom above all others he
preferred for a son-in-law, was as a crown to his
prosperity.</p>

<p>“We will have a grand wedding, O Margam,”
said Hassan to his wife; “a great <i>tamasha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
plenty of feasting!”</p>

<p>“And my daughter shall have goodly garments,
meet for the bride of Yuhanna,”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> said the smiling
Margam. “She shall have a shawl woven at Amritsar,
and embroidery from Delhi, and slippers
worked in blue and silver, such as are worn by the
begum.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“And what shall I have, O father?” cried little
Yusuf, the youngest child of the moonshee, and dear
to his heart as the light of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Thou at the wedding of thy sister shalt have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
new pugree with a border of gold,” said Hassan,
bending down to kiss fondly the brow of his child.</p>

<p>“For the wedding festivities and the goodly garments
money must be borrowed,” observed Margam,
who knew that the expenses to be incurred would
amount to a sum much greater than her husband
could earn in a year by teaching.</p>

<p>“Yes, I must borrow,” said Hassan calmly, but
with a look of thought. “To whom shall I go for
the money?”</p>

<p>“To Nabi Bakhsh,” suggested Margam.</p>

<p>“Not to Nabi Bakhsh, of all men!” exclaimed
the moonshee; “he is an usurer who would squeeze
juice out of a date-stone! Not to Sadik, for I owe
him five rupees already.”</p>

<p>“There is the English Sahib; he is a great friend
of my lord,” observed Margam; “surely when he
hears that the money is required for a wedding-feast
he will be ready to lend.”</p>

<p>“And Alton Sahib is able to do so,” cried Hassan;
“his salary is five hundred rupees a month, and I
doubt that he spends more than three. He has the
smallest and worst bungalow in the station, and
keeps fewer servants than a clerk on the railway
would do. The Sahib must be laying up money;
and he is so much my friend that I am sure that
he would help me in this my need. To-day is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
holiday in the school where I teach; my time is
therefore my own, and I will go at once to the
Sahib.”</p>

<p>“And as you come back by the bazaar, O father,”
cried the eager little Yusuf, “be sure that you do
not forget to buy for me the pretty new pugree with
a border of gold.”</p>

<p>“I will not forget it, O my child,” said the
moonshee with a smile, as he rose to depart.</p>

<p>Hassan had pleasant thoughts whilst he went on
his way towards the bungalow of Alton Sahib. He
considered how the Lord had brought him through
all his troubles, and after the storm of adversity had
given the sunshine of joy to His servant. “Those
who despised me will envy me now,” thought
Hassan; “my daughter is to marry a good man and
a prosperous man, and the grand feast which I shall
prepare will show to all that this is an occasion of
great joy and rejoicing.”</p>

<p>When Hassan came in sight of the little bungalow
of Alton Sahib, his thoughts flowed in another
channel.</p>

<p>“It is strange that a government Sahib should
choose to live in a place little better than a stable,”
said the moonshee to himself. “That bungalow is
only fit for owls and rats, and will come down in
the next rains. The Sahib is at home, I see, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
there is the syce<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> leading away his horse from the
door. Horse, did I call it! How can an English
Sahib ride such a wretched tattú?<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The tall man’s
feet must almost touch the ground as he rides.
There is only one thing which I do not like about
Alton Sahib. He is as good a Christian and as
true a friend as ever trod the earth, but he must
have a close fist, and be uncommonly fond of his
money. I never hear of his entertaining a friend:
and he seems to make his coat last for ever; I
wonder whether he ever intends to buy a new one!
I like a Sahib to spend freely, and never take to
counting the pice. Does not the Bible say, ‘Lay
not up for yourselves treasures on earth’? Why does
one who loves God as the Sahib does hoard up his
money thus? It is a grievous fault in the Sahib.”</p>

<p>Hassan forgot the Sahib’s fault when he stood in
his presence, met his kindly smile, and heard his
hearty congratulations on the approaching marriage
in his family. Hassan was asked to take a seat;
there were but two chairs in the room, which was
very poorly furnished indeed.</p>

<p>Alton Sahib listened smilingly to all that Hassan
had to tell him about the baboo who was to become
his son-in-law,—how much respected he was by all,
and how much property he had in his village. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the smile passed from the Sahib’s face when Hassan,
after much other conversation, told the object of his
visit, and asked for a loan of two hundred rupees.</p>

<p>“I have not the money,” said the Sahib gravely;
“and if I had, it would be against my conscience to
lend it.”</p>

<p>Hassan could scarcely refrain from an exclamation
of surprise. He glanced round the room in which
he sat, and Alton Sahib, who quickly read the minds
of men, perceived that in that of the moonshee was
arising the thought, “Can the Sahib be speaking the
truth?”</p>

<p>The face of the Englishman flushed; he hesitated
for several moments, as if it were a painful effort to
him to utter that which he was about to say.</p>

<p>“Hassan, I seldom speak to any one about my
private affairs,” said the Sahib at last; “but I
believe that it will be better both for you and for
myself if I do so now. You think me close-handed
and unwilling to part with my money; you may
even think me insincere, and therefore a most inconsistent
Christian; but I spoke but truth when I
said that I had no money. The fact is”—the Sahib
lowered his voice as he went on—“the fact is, that
I am in debt to a friend;” and the flush on the
young man’s brow and cheek deepened as he uttered
the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Hassan’s surprise was now twofold; he wondered
how the prudent Sahib could have got into debt,
and he wondered why any one should blush to own
that he had done so. There was nothing shameful
to Hassan in the idea of being in debt; like many
of his countrymen, he thought it a very small matter,
scarcely a misfortune, and not in the least degree a
disgrace. It was clear that debt was not regarded
in the same light by the English Christian.</p>

<p>It had often been a matter of regret to Alton
Sahib to see how lightly debt weighed on the
consciences of many in India. He took a deep
interest in the spiritual welfare of Hassan, whom he
regarded as a brother in Christ. “Shall I see my
brother sin, and not tell him of his error?” thought
Alton Sahib. “Debt in this land is as the canker-worm
in the grain, or the hidden abscess in the
human frame. I can best show Hassan how I abhor
it by letting him know what efforts I have myself
made, and am now making, to get rid of the
plague.”</p>

<p>“I feel it due to myself to let you know something
of the circumstances that involved me in the
debt from which I am, and have been for years,
struggling to free myself,” said the young Sahib,
after another pause. “When I was in Calcutta,
not long after my first arrival in this country, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
robbed at a hotel of all the ready money which I
possessed. This was, of course, a source of annoyance
to me, but not of serious difficulty, as I had a
wealthy friend in a station in Bengal, who would, I
knew, at once advance whatever I required to pay
my hotel-bill, and to take me up to the Punjaub, the
province to which I had been appointed. I believed
that the loan would be very soon repaid by my
father in England.”</p>

<p>“Your excellency’s mind must have been quite at
rest in the matter,” observed the moonshee.</p>

<p>“As I dipped my pen,” continued the Sahib, “to
write to my friend the judge to ask for a loan of
three hundred rupees, the very smallest sum that
would suffice to cover needful expenses, a servant
brought in letters from England. I laid down my
pen and opened the first one, little guessing the
heavy news which it would contain. The letter informed
me that, by the failure of a bank, all my
father’s property, the savings of many years, had
been swept away; and that he who had risen in the
morning believing himself to be in affluence, had
lain down at night in a state of poverty, which illness
made more distressing.”</p>

<p>“Alas! the news was heavy indeed!” exclaimed
Hassan.</p>

<p>“My father has since been called to that happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
home where there is no more trial,” said Alton Sahib
with a sigh; “he had laid up treasure in heaven, in
that bank which never can fail. But at the time
of which I speak his need was pressing; I wrote to
the judge in haste, but instead of borrowing, as I
had intended, three hundred rupees with the assurance
that the money would be repaid in two months,
I asked for the loan of five thousand rupees, to be
repaid I knew not when, that I might send home
help at once to my sick and afflicted father.”</p>

<p>“And the Judge Sahib gave the money?” asked
Hassan.</p>

<p>“At once, most generously, most readily,” replied
the young English Sahib; “nor do I believe that he
would ever ask me for one rupee of the money
again.”</p>

<p>“All is well, then, your excellency,” observed
Hassan; “the Judge Sahib is rich, he needs not the
money, the matter is no trouble to him.”</p>

<p>“But it has been a sore trouble to me,” cried the
young Sahib quickly; “I could no more sit down
quietly under that burden of debt, than I could
calmly endure to wear a chain of iron around my
neck. My life has been one perpetual effort to cast
off that chain; link by link I have broken it away.
I lived from the first on half my income—lived as
no other English gentleman in my position would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
do. When my salary was increased, I did not increase
my expenses. I have endured to be thought
stingy and inhospitable, in a land where not to have
the hand and the door open is esteemed a great
reproach. I could not give alms or entertain guests
on the money that was really another’s; it was
better in man’s sight to be unjustly considered mean,
than in the sight of God to be dishonest.”</p>

<p>“Dishonest!” exclaimed Hassan in astonishment;
the word did not seem in his mind to be in the least
suited for the occasion.</p>

<p>“Yes, dishonest,” repeated the Sahib; “money
which we have borrowed is not really our own,—it
belongs to the lender.”</p>

<p>“It was his pleasure to lend it,” observed Hassan.</p>

<p>“But not his pleasure that it should never be
returned,” rejoined the Sahib with animation.</p>

<p>Still the moonshee did not appear persuaded that
there could be any harm in incurring a debt to a
man who was rich enough to spare the money.</p>

<p>Alton Sahib rose and went up to his table, on
which lay a Bible. He turned over the pages, and
then silently pointed out the text,—<i>Owe no man
anything, but to love one another</i> (Rom. xiii. 8).</p>

<p>“I knew not that such a command was in the
Bible,” observed the moonshee. “But the Sahib
was under necessity to break it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Conscience does not reproach me for incurring
my debt,” said Alton Sahib gravely, “but conscience
would give me no rest if I neglected doing my utmost
to pay back what I owe. I hope, when my
last month’s salary comes in on Monday, to send
back the last rupee to my friend; and the day on
which I find myself free from debt will doubtless be
one of the happiest days of my life.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then the Sahib will be able, after all, to
lend to his servant!” exclaimed Hassan with
pleasure; “the marriage of my daughter will not
take place for more than a month.”</p>

<p>Alton Sahib felt vexed that all that he had said
had had so little effect on the mind of the Christian
moonshee. The young man closed the Bible and
returned to his seat.</p>

<p>“Moonshee Jé,” he said, “I borrowed money from
pressing necessity; you would borrow without necessity.”</p>

<p>Again surprise awoke in the breast of the moonshee.
“Did I not tell your excellency,” he said,
“that I required money for the wedding festivities
of my daughter?”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>“And what necessity is there that those festivities
should involve you in great expense, or entangle you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in debt?” said Alton Sahib. “If you could be
content to put aside pride and ostentation, to place
simple fare before a moderate number of guests, and
avoid all waste and show, your own means would
suffice for the marriage expenses. Will your
daughter be more happy as a wife, because her
wedding-feast has made her father act in a way that
befits not a Christian? Is God’s blessing on the
union to be procured by disobeying God’s command?
What profit is there in an expensive wedding-feast?”</p>

<p>“It is the dastur,”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> observed Hassan, as if that
expression were a sufficient answer to all objections.</p>

<p>“O my friend!” exclaimed Alton Sahib, “you
who condemn the worship of idols, make not for
yourself an idol of dastur. It was once the dastur
in England for Sahibs who received a slight affront
to call out the offender to some retired spot, that
the two might shoot at each other with pistols, that
so the offence, however small, might be wiped out
in blood.”</p>

<p>“A very evil dastur,” remarked the moonshee.</p>

<p>“But one so generally observed, that it was
thought the deepest dishonour to break through it,”
said Alton Sahib. “But men were found brave and
faithful enough to break through such a dastur for
the sake of Christ and the gospel. It is now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
dastur amongst Mohammedans to recite the praises
of their prophet; it is the dastur amongst Brahmins
to wear their holy threads; but you have broken
through your dastur, and Brahmins, converted like
yourself to the Christian religion, have cast aside
their much-valued threads. Will you, O my friend,
reserve <i>any</i> dastur that is contrary to the will of
God? Will you say to your Heavenly King, ‘Lord!
I have given up for Thee the love of brethren, the
favour of friends, many of the things which I prized
most upon earth; but I cannot—will not—even to
obey Thee, give up the dastur of half-ruining myself
to have a grand wedding-feast. I at my baptism
renounced “the world, the flesh, and the devil,” but
I reserved one thing which is of the world which I
will not renounce.’”</p>

<p>The face of the moonshee looked troubled. His
friend had pointed out sin where he had hitherto
seen no sin; dishonesty in what he had never considered
dishonest; shame in what he had never
thought shameful. With a deep sigh he made
reply: “It is not for myself that I care; but what
would those of my household say if I bade them, on
such an occasion, act differently from all those who
dwell around them!” Before the mind of the
moonshee arose the images of Margam and Fatima,
and the loved child who was perhaps the dearest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
all. How could he bear to disappoint them, and
expose them to the taunts of their neighbours!</p>

<p>“Go to your family; they too are Christians,”
said Alton Sahib, “and, I trust, Christians not only
in name. Repeat to them what I have said to you
to-day. Ask them whether the pride of life which
leads to sinful debt be not condemned in this verse?—‘All
that is in the world, the lust of the flesh,
and the lust of the eyes, and the <i>pride of life</i>, is not
of the Father, but is of the world. And the world
passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth
the will of God abideth for ever’ (1 John ii. 16, 17).
Ask them whether in another world, nay, even one
year hence, the remembrance that a foolish dastur
was given up for conscience’ sake will not be sweeter
than the recollection of the grandest display at a
wedding? The praise of man is as the gay paper-lamps
at an illumination, that last but for a night;
the praise of God is as the stars in the sky, that
shone ere the day of our birth, and which will
shine long after our bodies have been laid in the
tomb.”</p>

<p>Hassan arose, made his salám, and took his
departure. His reason was convinced, his conscience
was aroused, he was almost persuaded to have a
simple and inexpensive wedding; but whenever he
thought of his family his resolution gave way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will not return through the bazaar,” said
Hassan to himself rather sadly; “I should be too
much tempted to buy for my darling the pugree with
a border of gold!”</p>

<p>No sooner was the shadow of Hassan seen on the
threshold of his home than little Yusuf, full of eagerness,
ran forward to meet his father. The child
looked to see whether the moonshee had brought
anything in his hand, and the face of the little one
showed disappointment when he saw that the hand
was empty.</p>

<p>“O father!” exclaimed Yusuf, “you have forgotten
my pugree!”</p>

<p>“I forgot it not, my son,” said the moonshee, as,
entering the inner apartment, he seated himself on
his carpet.</p>

<p>“Has my lord ordered any of the things needed
for the great day which is coming?” asked the
smiling Margam, who was preparing the moonshee’s
hookah. Fatima thought of bangles<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and ear-rings,
but she was too shy to utter a word.</p>

<p>“I have delayed making my preparations,” said
the moonshee.</p>

<p>Margam saw that the mind of her husband was
perplexed with much thought. “Has the English
Sahib then given nothing?” she ventured to ask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Sahib has given a great deal of good advice,
but advice which we should all find it very hard to
follow,” replied the convert. “Be seated, O Margam
and Fatima, and you shall hear what the Sahib says
regarding grand marriage festivities, and the debts
to which, in this country, they almost necessarily
lead.”</p>

<p>Wondering, and rather fearing what might be
coming, Margam and Fatima seated themselves on
the floor and listened. Little Yusuf took his
favourite place close to his father, whose hand he
fondled in both his own. The moonshee then repeated,
almost word for word, what had passed
between himself and his English friend. Margam
broke in every now and then with an exclamation
of surprise or displeasure; but Fatima listened in
silence, with her glance bent on the ground. The
large eyes of Yusuf were never taken from the face
of his father; the child was eagerly drinking in all
that was uttered. Though he could not understand
every word, Yusuf took in the general meaning of
much that was said.</p>

<p>When the moonshee ceased, there was a short
silence in the room. Margam looked vexed, and
the downcast eyes of Fatima were brimming over
with tears. It would be to these women, Christians
though they were, a terrible trial to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
through dastur on such an occasion as that of a
wedding.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>“I leave the decision to you all,” said the moonshee,
glad perhaps thus to escape from himself deciding
so difficult a question. “Shall I borrow from
some one else, and have all things arranged according
to dastur; or shall we give up everything that
is not necessary, to avoid displeasing God by incurring
debt?”</p>

<p>Again there was a short silence. Little Yusuf
was the first to break it. Clinging to his father,
the child raised himself to a position high enough for
his lips almost to reach his parent’s ear, and then
said in a whisper,—which was, however, distinct
enough to be heard by all present,—“I will please
the Lord Jesus by giving up my pugree bordered
with gold.”</p>

<p>The most learned discourse could not have had
more effect than those simple words of the child.
The vexed look on the mother’s face changed to a
smile; and though two big tears dropped down the
cheeks of Fatima, she was able cheerfully to say, “I
would rather please the Lord Jesus than have
Malika Victoria’s jewel, the grand Koh-i-noor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>A few weeks afterwards, the marriage took place.
Great was the surprise amongst the neighbours of
Hassan at the simple arrangements made for the
wedding. The feast was chiefly of fruit, the ornaments
chiefly of flowers; but the fruit was sweet,
and the flowers fairer than anything that man’s hand
could have made. Fatima was a very happy bride,
for she thought to herself, “As the Lord deigned to
come to the marriage at Cana, we can ask Him to be
present at this simple feast, where there is nothing
which my dear father is not able to pay for.” And
no face at the wedding looked brighter than that
of little Yusuf; the snow-white pugree above that
happy young face needed no border of gold!</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hear, the story of Buté, the moonshee’s
only daughter.</p>

<p>Buté had, when she was but a babe
in arms, lost her mother, but she was to her father
as the light of his eyes. The moonshee often went
to teach a Mem Sahiba,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> whose husband was in
government employ. The Mem Sahiba was kind
to little Buté; she let her sometimes come to her
bungalow, and gave her sweetmeats, and once a doll
from England. Those were happy days to little
Buté when her father, taking her hand, led her to
the white bungalow in which the Mem Sahiba dwelt.</p>

<p>One day the Mem Sahiba said to the moonshee:
“The Sahib wishes to go on a journey into Cashmere,
and to take you with him; are you willing to go
for six months with the Sahib?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The moonshee’s heart was glad, for he had long
wished to visit the beautiful Vale of Cashmere; but
then trouble came over him like a shadow, for he
thought of his little Buté.</p>

<p>“If I go far from hence,” said he, “what will
become of my only child? Behold, I have but one,
and her mother is dead, and I have no sisters who
would be to her as a mother. Buté, if I leave her,
will be as a stray lamb that is found by the jackals.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear for Buté,” the Mem Sahiba made
reply; “if it be your wish, I will place her in the
school at Khushpore, for the Miss Sahiba there is
my friend. Buté shall learn to read and to write,
and all that is good will she learn; for the Miss
Sahiba is one who fears God, and she dearly loves
little children.”</p>

<p>And thus was it arranged; the moonshee went to
Cashmere with the Sahib, and little Buté was sent
to the school at Khushpore.</p>

<p>Buté shed many tears at parting from her father,
but her tears were soon dried. The Miss Sahiba
looked kindly upon her, and spoke sweet words;
and though Buté was shy at first, and hung down
her head in silence, even before the end of the day
she was as merry as the little gray striped squirrel
that runs up the trees, and hides in the branches.</p>

<p>Buté had now many companions, and soon made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
friends with them all. Very fond was the little girl
of talking, and in the hours of play the words from
her tongue flowed on as the brook that runs down
from the hills. Buté liked to speak much of the
Mem Sahiba whom none of the other girls had seen,
and of the grand things in her house. Buté did not
take any heed to speak truth, so that the stream
of her words was not pure, but as a muddy and
polluted brook.</p>

<p>“My Mem Sahiba,” the child would say, “has
more shining rings on her fingers than there are leaves
on that tree. The Sahib is a very great man;
those who come near him bow down to the ground,
and when he goes forth he rides on an elephant with
a howdah of gold.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Some of Buté’s companions wondered when they
heard her stories, and some laughed and called them
<i>jhuth muth</i> (fibs); but when the Miss Sahiba heard
them she never laughed, but she sighed, and her
gentle face grew grave. Often, when alone in her
room, the Miss Sahiba would kneel down and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pray to the God in heaven who listens to prayer:
“O Lord, show my dear children the shame and the
sin of lying! Teach them Thy way of truth; make
them holy, for Thou art holy!”</p>

<p>When Buté came to school, she wore a chaddar
pink as the petals of a rose. The Miss Sahiba did
not much like to see this chaddar, for those worn by
all her other girls were white. But Buté did not
wish to change her pink garment for a plain white
one.</p>

<p>“I cannot leave off wearing this chaddar,” she
said, drawing it closer round her slight form. “My
Mem Sahiba gave it to me, and she told me always
to wear it.”</p>

<p>The Miss Sahiba made no reply, but her mind
was not at rest. She thought to herself,—“I never
know whether Buté be speaking the truth or not.
Oh that I could but trust her word! I love my
little Buté—she is gentle and docile, quick at her
lessons, never cross, and ready to do a kindness to
any of her companions; but a pleasant child with
a deceitful heart is like a fruit that looks fair to the
eye, but which is all decayed and worthless within.”</p>

<p>The Miss Sahiba used often to gather the children
around her and talk with them when the hours for
lessons were over; and much did they like to listen.
Sometimes she told them of the dear mother whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
she had left behind in England, that she might
come and teach little Indian children the way to
heaven.</p>

<p>The Miss Sahiba sat in the schoolroom on one hot
summer’s day, when the weather was too sultry for
even her native children to go out, and they were
seated on the floor around her. The Miss Sahiba
felt weary and faint, for she had come from a land
where the heat is never great, and the glow of India
was to her almost as that of a fiery furnace. But
she thought that her dear Lord had given her these
children as His little lambs to feed, and she was
willing to live and even to die far away from her
own home, if she only might be permitted to lead
these children to the Lord Jesus, the Good Shepherd,
who gave His life for the sheep.</p>

<p>“I think that there was never a better mother
than mine,” said the Miss Sahiba, as she showed to
the children a little picture of her dear parent which
she had just received from England. “My mother
was always kind and good to me, but there were
three occasions in my life on which she showed the
greatest love; and whenever I recall these occasions
to mind, I bless God for having given me such a
good mother.”</p>

<p>The children were eager to hear more, and little
Buté, who sat nearest to the feet of the Miss Sahiba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
looked up into her face and said, “Tell us of these
three times when the Mem Sahiba in England showed
so much love.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” replied the Miss Sahiba; “and
you shall judge on which occasion the greatest love
was shown.</p>

<p>“The first time was when I was sick with the
small-pox. Day and night my dear mother watched
by my bed. If, after feverish sleep, I opened my
eyes at midnight, there, close at hand, ready with
the medicine or cooling drink, I ever saw my beloved
mother. But for her tender care, I believe that I
should have died. Was it not true love that made
her watch over me thus?”</p>

<p>The Miss Sahiba paused, and all the children who
had heard her replied, “It was very great love.”</p>

<p>“The second occasion was this,” the Miss Sahiba
went on. “One evening in winter, when the fire
was lighted in our sitting-room, I saw above the
mantlepiece a picture that had been crookedly hung.
It was rather higher than I could reach with my
hand, so I brought a stool, and stood upon it, that
I might set the picture straight. I knew not that
my dress, as I stood, had touched the fire, until, to
my great terror, I found myself all in flames! My
shrieks brought my mother to my aid. She threw
me down on the floor; she wrapped a thick rug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
around me; with her own dear hands, all scorched
and blistered, she put out the fire. Never shall I
forget how my mother then clasped me to her heart,
and wept, and thanked God who had enabled her to
save her child from a terrible death. She was herself
in very great pain from her burns, but she scarcely
thought of the pain.”</p>

<p>Again the Miss Sahiba paused, and one and all of
the children said, “The Mem Sahiba showed very
great love.”</p>

<p>“On the third occasion, of which I am going to
tell you,” said the English Sahiba, “I think that
even greater love was shown, for my mother saved
me from something worse than even fever or fire.”</p>

<p>Then every child bent forward to listen, and
wondering, thought in her heart, “What can be worse
than fever or fire?”</p>

<p>“The third time when my mother showed how
well she loved me,” continued the Sahiba, “was—when
she gave me a beating for telling a lie!”</p>

<p>The children were all so much astonished that
they could not utter a word. They opened their
black eyes wide, and stared at the Sahiba. Buté
began to laugh,—it seemed so strange to her that a
beating should be called a proof of great love!</p>

<p>“Oh! well, well do I recollect the grief of my
mother when she found that her little girl had spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
an untruth!” said the Miss Sahiba. “The pain to
her heart was worse, far worse, than the pain of the
burns had been to her hands. She told me, with
tears in her eyes, that lying lips are an abomination
to the Lord, that liars will be shut out from heaven.
She punished me, but not in anger; oh no, but in
very great sorrow and love. Then she and I knelt
down together to ask God to forgive my great sin.
I could not speak because of my sobs; but I heard
my mother ask God to blot out her child’s sin in the
blood of His dear Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, that
which alone can wash away sin. My mother prayed—oh,
how hard she prayed!—while the tears ran
down her cheeks, that God, for the sake of the Lord
Jesus Christ, would give me His Holy Spirit, to make
my sinful heart clean, and to guide me into all truth.
Dear children, I shall never forget that day, either
the punishment or the prayer. Thanks to my
mother who gave the punishment, thanks to God
who heard the prayer, I believe that I have never
since that time uttered a lie. Now, tell me, my
dear children, did not my mother do more for me
then, did she not show more true love for me on
that sad day, than when she watched me through
my illness, or saved my life from the flames?”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the girls said “Yes;” but one of them
whispered softly, “It does not seem so to me.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you why I think it,” said the Miss
Sahiba, who had heard the whisper. “Sin is a
worse evil than fever, and the fire of God’s anger
worse than fire that only burns the body. It was
pain to my mother to punish me; but she did not
shrink from the pain, no more than she shrank from
throwing me down on the floor, or scorching her own
hands when she was trying to put out the flames.”</p>

<p>Many of the girls were listening with interest and
attention; but the Miss Sahiba saw but too well
that Buté did not care for good counsel. The child’s
eyes had wandered to the picture which the Miss
Sahiba still held in her hand; and while others were
thinking of the lesson of truth taught by the lady,
Buté only asked the trifling question, “Is the frame
of that picture real gold?”</p>

<p>Alas! that when God’s servants speak of heaven
and the way to reach it, and of other solemn truths,
some who might listen and learn let their attention
be drawn away by the merest trifles. It is as if a
person to whom a diamond is offered should turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
away to chase a butterfly; or as if one fleeing from
a tiger should stop to pluck a flower by the way.</p>

<p>It was not many days after that on which the
Miss Sahiba had told her story, that her first friend,
the Mem Sahiba, came to visit the school at Khushpore.
It is easy to be imagined that Buté was
rejoiced again to see her kind friend; and in honour
of the visit, the Miss Sahiba promised all the children
a feast of fruit.</p>

<p>The two ladies walked up the room in which the
classes were assembled, and as they came near the
place where Buté stood with her eyes sparkling with
pleasure, the Miss Sahiba said to her friend, “Here
is your little Buté, in the pink chaddar which she
says that you gave her and told her to wear.”</p>

<p>“I never gave her a chaddar of any colour,” said
the Mem Sahiba with a look of surprise; “what
could make the silly child utter such an untruth?”</p>

<p>Do you think that Buté blushed and hung down
her head in shame at having been found out guilty
of lying? Alas! no. Buté had told so many lies
in her short life that she felt no sorrow or shame for
the sin. She was only vexed that the Miss Sahiba
should know of her falsehood.</p>

<p>If Buté did not care, the Miss Sahiba cared a
great deal. She thought, “Oh, how shall I cure
this poor child of her terrible habit?” Then turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
towards Buté, she said aloud, “Buté, I grieve
to find that you have told me an untruth. I cannot
let you share in our feast. Retire to the sleeping-room
directly; I should not be your true friend if I
passed over this matter.”</p>

<p>Then Buté began to cry; not because of sorrow
for sin, but because she had lost the feast, and was
sent so early to bed. She clasped her hands, and
glanced towards her former friend, the Mem Sahiba,
as if to entreat her intercession; but the lady looked
grave and shook her head. She knew that the
punishment had been deserved, and that it would be
no real kindness not to inflict it.</p>

<p>But still poor Buté, accustomed from her infancy
to hear lies, could not but think herself hardly dealt
with. Had her lie got any one into trouble, had
she slandered a companion, she would have seen
that sin had been committed; “But what did it
signify,” thought she, “whether I said truly that
the chaddar had been given to me by my father; or
untruly, that it had been given to me by the Mem
Sahiba?” As Buté turned weeping to go to her
room, the Miss Sahiba heard her murmur between
her sobs, “Why does she make such a fuss? What
harm could the lie do? it was such a little one!”</p>

<p>The feast of fruit began; plenty of nice kélas
(plantains) were spread on the floor. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
girls were sorry for Buté, sent to remain in her bed
to think over her fault; but soon even these girls
forgot the poor child, who could hear from her apartment
the sound of their laughter and singing. Buté
lay crying, listening to the children’s voices, and
longing to join them.</p>

<p>As the Miss Sahiba, with her friend, sat watching
the young people enjoying their fruit, she was
suddenly startled by a scream from the neighbouring
room, which was that to which Buté had been sent
in disgrace. The scream expressed violent terror or
pain; and the Miss Sahiba, who loved the child whom
she punished, rushed into the room with such speed
to see what could be the matter, that almost before
the girls had time to cry, “What has happened?”
the lady was at the side of her poor little charge.</p>

<p>Buté was standing on her bed, her face pale with
terror, looking at a small black scorpion which was
running across the floor. The Miss Sahiba’s heel in
a moment had crushed the scorpion, and in a quiet,
composed manner she turned to Buté. “Why did
you scream so?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It was on my bed—close—quite close to me!
I just raised my arm, and it fell on the floor,” cried
Buté, who was trembling violently from the effects
of the fright.</p>

<p>“Why did you make such a fuss?” said the Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Sahiba, after motioning to the girls, who were crowding
into the room, to leave her alone with Buté.</p>

<p>“How could I help making a fuss?” exclaimed
the astonished Buté; “the dreadful thing might
have stung me!”</p>

<p>“Likely enough,” said the Miss Sahiba coldly, as
she seated herself on the edge of the bed; “but
what harm could it do?”</p>

<p>Buté was more and more surprised. “It was a
horrid poisonous creature!” she cried.</p>

<p>“It was such a <i>little one</i>,” said the lady, looking
steadfastly into the face of the girl.</p>

<p>Buté did not know what to make of her teacher
taking the matter so quietly; she herself was not
disposed to take it quietly at all. “I wish that
you would have the place searched,—oh, every
corner of it!” she cried. “I should not wonder if
a whole nest of scorpions were hidden in some hole
in the wall!”</p>

<p>“That’s likely enough,” said the Miss Sahiba
quietly; “this is a season for insects. I saw pretty
fire-flies last night; I am going to look for them
again in the compound.”</p>

<p>“You think of fire-flies, when there may be
scorpions in this very room!” exclaimed Buté.
“The Sahiba does not seem to care for the danger
to her poor little girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the manner of the lady quite altered; the
cold, careless look changed to one of earnestness and
love. She drew the frightened Buté close to her,
held her little trembling hand in one of her own,
and with the other pointed to the dead scorpion
which lay on the floor.</p>

<p>“O my child!” she cried, “see in that poisonous
reptile a type of your own sin of untruth. That
scorpion could only hurt the body; but falsehood
poisons the soul. Who but a fool would play with
a scorpion and say, ‘It is but a little one,’ instead
of crushing it at once! Who but a fool would
amuse himself with fire-flies when poisonous reptiles
were lurking near! Buté, my poor child, how many
lies, more hateful than scorpions, have been suffered
to nestle in your bosom and to come forth from your
lips! And you think me hard and severe because I
wish to crush them, because I warn you against the
sin which God hates. You were grieved and disappointed
at being shut out from a little feast which
would soon have been over; but think what it
would be to be shut out for ever from heaven, from
its brightness and glory and joy! And it is written
in God’s holy Word, <i>There shall in no wise enter
into it anything that defileth or maketh a lie</i>.”</p>

<p>The Miss Sahiba added many more words, and
this time they fell on an attentive ear. She taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Buté how to pray for forgiveness of past sin, and
for the Holy Spirit of God, through whom alone
she could conquer her sin in the future. Little Buté
learned a prayer before she went to sleep that night,
and she thought of it the very first thing when her
eyes unclosed in the morning. While Buté prayed
that God would make her truthful and holy, she also
tried very hard herself to be truthful and holy.
Soon all her companions saw a great change in little
Buté. Her face grew brighter as her heart grew
more pure; for we never are so happy as when we
feel that the smile of the Lord is upon us. No girl
in the school was more loved and trusted than she
who had once been constantly uttering falsehoods;
and when she spoke of anything that had happened,
however strange the tale might be, it was instantly
believed. It became a common saying amongst
those who knew her, “I would rather doubt my
own eyes than the word of Buté.”</p>

<span class="smaller">The Story of Three Jewels.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hear the parable of three jewels—a Ruby,
a Pearl, and a Diamond.</p>

<p>There lived in a country far beyond
the dark waters a mighty Rajah, whose name was
Kamíl Rahím (All-merciful). Though his home
was so distant, he had sons who dwelt in the land
of Hindostan; and the names of these sons were
Mulá Mal, Biharí Lal, Tulsí Rám, and Nihál Chand.</p>

<p>One day the Rajah called one of his servants
whose name was Narayan Das (Servant of God),
and thus he gave him command:—</p>

<p>“Go thou to the land in which dwell my four
sons, and speak to them thus: Thus saith the
Father whom ye see not, but who cares for you
and loves you, and desires to give treasure to you
out of the abundance of his great riches. Leave the
city in which you dwell, cross the river which lies
to the east, and, by the path of which my servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
will tell you, reach a certain mountain. There you
will behold by the wayside a landmark in the shape
of a Cross. Dig at the foot of it, and lo! you will
find a treasure. There is a jewel which is a royal
gift from myself, such as none but myself can bestow.
In a setting of pure gold are three gems—a ruby,
of which the name is Pardon; a pearl, of which the
name is Purity; and a diamond, of which the name
is Heaven. He who wears the ruby over his heart
will be preserved in danger; he who wears the
pearl over his heart will be kept in health; he who
in the same manner wears the diamond will become
the heir to a throne. All the treasures of earth are
not to be weighed in the balance against these jewels,
Pardon, Purity, and Heaven.”</p>

<p>The servant Narayan Das prostrated himself before
his great Master, and said, “The will of my Lord
shall be obeyed.” Narayan Das had a happy home,
but he went forth from it; he had parents whom
he loved, but he bade them farewell. The sea was
wide and the waves were rough, but he feared not
to cross them; lo! he had good tidings to bear to
the sons of his Lord, and the joy of bearing them
repaid him for all the toils and dangers of the journey
before him.</p>

<p>After a long and stormy voyage, the messenger
from the Father reached the land of Hindostan; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a few days afterwards he arrived at the city in
which the four brothers dwelt, even Mulá Mal,
Biharí Lal, Tulsí Rám, and Nihál Chand. Narayan
Das was weary and faint, but he would not rest till
he had inquired the way to the dwelling of Mulá
Mal, who was the eldest of the four brothers, who
lived in different quarters of the same city.</p>

<p>When the messenger entered the presence of Mulá
Mal, he saw in him a man who had upon his brow
the spot which marked a worshipper of the goddess
Kalí.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It was the morning of a great festival, and
Mulá Mal was about to set forth to bathe in the
Ganges,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and to do puja (worship) to the idol whom
he adored.</p>

<p>“O Mulá Mal!” cried Narayan Das, “I bring to
you good tidings from your great and all-merciful
Father. There is a treasure hidden for you at the
foot of a Cross, and I can direct you how to find it.
But you must set forth at once, or, behold! another
may take the treasure, and you may lose for ever
the opportunity of gaining these jewels, Pardon,
Purity, and Heaven.”</p>

<p>But Mulá Mal thought scorn of the faithful messenger,
because he was not in face or garb as one of
the people of Hindostan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who art thou, O man of the pale cheek and red
beard?” he cried; “and what dost thou ask at my
hand?”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>“I am a servant of Kamíl Rahím, and your friend;
and I come, not to take from you, but to give to
you,” replied Narayan Das; “yea, I have risked my
life to bring to you good tidings from afar.”</p>

<p>“I care not for thy tidings, nor do I believe thy
word,” cried Mulá Mal with contempt. “Why dost
thou delay me, when I am about to do puja to my
great goddess?”</p>

<p>“O my lord,” cried Narayan Das earnestly,
“there is no image made by the hands of man that
can bestow on its worshipper Pardon, Purity, and
Heaven. Wherefore will my lord not listen? Will
he spurn from him the richest of treasures,—even
treasures that will, if worn over the heart, preserve
him in danger, keep him in health, and make him
the heir to a throne? Read but this letter from
your Father, and see in it the truth of all that I
have spoken;” and Narayan Das drew from his
bosom a book on which was inscribed these words:
“The Holy Scriptures.”</p>

<p>“Away with thy book!” cried the worshipper of
Kalí; “I desire not thy jewels, nor will I listen to thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment there was heard a loud noise of
drumming and shouting; a great multitude was
about to pour forth from the city to worship the
idol. And with the multitude Mulá Mal went forth:
he had despised the message of his Father; he had
lost the treasure which had been freely offered to
him,—even Pardon, Purity, and Heaven.</p>

<p>Narayan Das sighed deeply. “Alas!” he cried,
“woe is me that the ear should be closed to the
voice of friendship, and that the eye should be
turned away from the gift of a Father’s love! But
if my message be rejected by the first brother, it
may find a place in the heart of the second.”</p>

<p>By mere inquiries Narayan Das found the house
of the second son, Biharí Lal.</p>

<p>Biharí Lal was a more sensible man than
Mulá Mal, and he did not think scorn of the messenger,
nor of the message, as his brother had
done.</p>

<p>“Surely,” he said to himself, “no light cause
would have made this good man leave his country,
travel so great a distance, and go through so many
dangers to bring good tidings to me. Perhaps in
the place of which he tells me this treasure may
really be hidden. Would it not be wisdom in me
at least to read the letter which he says that my
Father has written, and to try whether the jewels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Pardon, Purity, and Heaven may not be found at
the foot of the Cross?”</p>

<p>Narayan Das saw with joy that Biharí Lal was
not as the deaf adder that will not hear the voice of
the charmer. He was not as the blind man who sits
hungry beneath the date-tree, and who knows not
that its clusters of fruit are within his reach.</p>

<p>“Oh haste, my lord!” cried the messenger; “for
if you delay, who knows whether you may not lose
for ever the ruby, the pearl, and the diamond which
are freely offered to you by your Father!”</p>

<p>But Biharí Lal made reply: “I cannot and I will
not set forth at once, nor have I time at present
even to read the letter of my Father. Bales of
merchandise have just arrived from Persia; I must
examine their contents. I have many friends in
the city, and I have invited them all to a banquet.
Business takes up my time, and what is left from
business is filled up by amusement. Go your way
now, O messenger! perhaps when I have nothing
else to do I may seek from you guidance to the
place where I may find the ruby, the pearl, and the
diamond, in their setting of gold.”</p>

<p>Thus absorbed in the business and cares of this
world, the man went on his way. Alas! never,
never was he to possess the treasure which he delayed
to search for! On the very day on which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
concluded a bargain which made him the richest
merchant in the city, even on the night on which
he had feasted at the house of a prince, he was
smitten down by cholera. Biharí Lal died in much
suffering; his body was burned, and his ashes were
cast into the Ganges. Never did he find the treasures
of Pardon, Purity, and Heaven! The acceptable
time for Biharí Lal had passed for ever away!</p>

<p>Then Narayan Das found his way to the house of
Tulsí Rám, who was the third of the brothers who
dwelt in that city.</p>

<p>Tulsí Rám was a man of a pleasant countenance
and of an open heart. When he heard of his
Father’s love, his whole face brightened; and when
he saw his Father’s letter, he pressed it first to his
heart and then to his brow. Nay, Tulsí Rám read
enough of the letter to feel sure that Narayan Das
was a true messenger, and that at the foot of the
Cross he was indeed sure to find the treasures of
Pardon, Purity, and Heaven. Gladly did Tulsí Rám
welcome the messenger who had come so far to
bring good tidings, and eagerly he asked his way to
the place where the jewels were buried.</p>

<p>“Will you accompany me thither?” asked Tulsí
Rám of Narayan Das.</p>

<p>The messenger shook his head. “I will show you
the road, but you must tread it alone,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Narayan Das. “Fear not if you find it rough and
thorny at first. Courage and perseverance are required
of him who would gain the treasures; has
any one ever yet conquered a kingdom by idly
sleeping on a bed of roses? Go forth boldly, O
Tulsí Rám! And forget not to take with you the
staff of Prayer; without its help you will never
overcome all the difficulties of the way.”</p>

<p>The countenance of Tulsí Rám grew grave when
he reflected on these difficulties, for he was not a
man of a resolute will. It needed much perseverance
on the part of Narayan Das to make Tulsí Rám
so much as start on his journey, though he did not
doubt the worth of the prize which he went forth
to seek.</p>

<p>And when Tulsí Rám set forth at last, he was as
one who seeth the eyes of a wild beast glaring behind
every bush; he was full of cowardly fears. Tulsí Rám
shrank back even from shadows; and when sharp
stones wounded his feet, he first felt inclined to sit
down and weep, and then to turn back and return
to his home. Yet some words in his Father’s letter
gave a little courage to Tulsí Rám:—<i>I will not
fail thee nor forsake thee; be strong and of a good
courage</i> (Josh. i. 5, 6). <i>Know ye not that they
which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the
prize? So run, that ye may obtain</i> (1 Cor. ix. 24).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the traveller came to the stream which it
was needful that he should cross; and the name of
that stream was Baptism. The waters were bright
and pure, but the banks were steep; and Tulsí Rám
saw that a plant with exceedingly sharp thorns
grew thickly upon those banks, and the name of
the plant was Persecution.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Tulsí Rám sat down on a stone on the top of the
nearer bank, and wrung his hands and beat his
breast, and groaned in the heaviness of his spirit.</p>

<p>“Oh, is there no other way than that of crossing
this river of Baptism,” he cried, “by which I can
reach the treasures offered to me by my Father,—even
the rich jewels which, worn over the heart,
will bring safety to the soul, health to the soul, and
the crown of eternal life? I dare not—oh, I dare
not go forward! I would rather lose that which I
feel to be indeed above all price, than encounter
those dreadful thorns. Alas, that the thorny plant
of Persecution should shut me out from the waters
of Baptism!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Tulsí Rám thought that he heard a voice,
sweeter than the voice of an angel; and it said,—<i>Fear
not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed,
for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I
will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right
hand of my righteousness</i> (Isa. xli. 10). <i>Be thou
faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
life</i> (Rev. ii. 10).</p>

<p>With fresh energy and hope Tulsí Rám arose and
attempted to descend the bank in order to cross over
the river; but, alas, he dropped the staff of Prayer,
and did not stoop to lift it again! Without that
staff he had not the strength to force his way
through the thorns of Persecution. Tulsí Rám tried
to press on for a time, but the thorns tore his garments
and wounded his flesh. His feet were bleeding
and sore, and his courage at last utterly failed
him. When Tulsí Rám had gone half-way down
the bank he stopped, groaned, hesitated, and then
turned back. Alas, for him who had dropped the
staff of Prayer! alas, for him who had lost the jewels
for which he longed, because he had not the courage
and perseverance to win them!</p>

<p>As Tulsí Rám was sadly returning to the city,
he met his youngest brother, Nihál Chand. He
beheld Nihál Chand hurrying on with a firm step
towards the river of Baptism; he looked not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the right hand nor to the left, for his was a resolute
spirit.</p>

<p>“How is it that thou art turning back, O Tulsí?”
he cried, when he saw his brother. “I knew that
thou didst start before me, but I hoped by quick
walking to overtake thee, so that we might together
find the priceless treasures, the glad tidings of which
have been brought to thee as well as to me.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my brother!” replied Tulsí Rám, with a
deep sigh, “I turn back because of the difficulties o£
the road. If no thorns of Persecution grew by the
river of Baptism, surely ere now I should have
crossed it; but see how my flesh has been torn!”</p>

<p>“Pardon, Purity, and Heaven,—the ruby, the
pearl, and the diamond,—are worth a little struggle
and a little pain,” said the resolute Nihál Chand.
“Though there were a lion in the way, he should
not stay me. It is written in the Book of my
Father,—<i>Though an host should encamp against
me, my heart shall not fear</i>.”</p>

<p>“O Nihál!” cried the timid-spirited Tulsí Rám,
“I am not as thou art; yet if it be my destiny to
wear the jewels,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> surely they will be mine, even
though I remain on this side of the waters of Baptism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
All is not in my own hands; who can
oppose the decrees of Fate?”</p>

<p>“Deceive not thyself, nor excuse thy own sloth
by talking about Fate!” exclaimed Nihál Chand.
“If, when thou wert preparing thy meal, a tiger
were to steal upon thee, wouldst thou quietly sit
still and say,—‘If it be my destiny, I shall eat
this dinner;’ or, ‘If it be my destiny, the tiger will
eat me’? No,” continued Nihál Chand with much
animation; “thou wouldst start up, snatch the
nearest weapon, and struggle for life like a man.
Even so, with courage and resolution, press on for
the prize set before thee.”</p>

<p>But Tulsí Rám only mournfully shook his head,
and with a slow step and a heavy heart returned to
the city.</p>

<p>“He is a poor, weak creature,” muttered Nihál
Chand, “and not worthy to wear the jewels which
he has not the courage to seek. I will go forward
without him.”</p>

<p>Nihál Chand was indeed a very different man
from any of his three brothers. He had more wisdom
than Mulá Mal, and his acute mind saw at
once the folly of bowing down to idols of wood and
stone. Nihál Chand was not, like Biharí Lal, inclined
to waste precious time in delay, and to give
up his whole soul to the cares of this perishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
world. And Nihál Chand, unlike Tulsí Rám, had a
firm and fearless spirit, and a will as strong as iron.
No thorns of Persecution could stay the resolute
man; he pressed through them as one who is shod
with brass. And when Nihál Chand had passed the
waters of Baptism, with what pleasure he looked
back and smiled! Then, feeling that the worst of
his trials was over, on Nihál hastened towards the
hill, which was soon in sight. He could now see,
at no great distance, the Cross at the foot of which
the treasure lay buried which had been given to
him by his Father.</p>

<p>On the way Nihál Chand was joined by a
stranger, who appeared to be travelling in the same
direction. The man was of very dark complexion,
but gaily dressed, and his name was Temptation.</p>

<p>After the usual salutation, Temptation thus addressed
Nihál Chand,—</p>

<p>“Brave and noble hero, the fame of your courage
hath spread far and wide, and has reached the ears
of your servant. I have beheld from afar with
what resolution you passed through the thorns of
Persecution as if they had been soft grass. Worthy
are you of the priceless jewels which will so soon be
in your grasp. How different are you from your
superstitious and worldly brothers, and how superior
to the weak and cowardly Tulsí Rám! Allow me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to be your companion, that, though I never myself
can possess them, I may at least have a sight of the
ruby, the pearl, and the diamond, that are to the
soul Pardon, Purity, and Heavenly Glory!”</p>

<p>Nihál Chand had at first suspected the stranger
to be a thief in disguise, and had stood on his guard
against him; but the honey of flattering words is
sweet. The ears of Nihál Chand were so charmed
by the praise that flowed from the lips of Temptation,
that he now suffered him to walk by his side
as if he had been a familiar friend.</p>

<p>Thus journeying together, the two men reached
the foot of the Cross. Nihál Chand had not forgotten
to take with him a spade for digging, and
now with energy he set to the task of removing the
earth. Temptation stood by watching him, and
praising his vigour now, as he before had praised
his courage.</p>

<p>Before Nihál Chand had laboured long, his spade
struck against something hard. He stooped and
lifted up from the earth a little casket of purest
gold. Opening this, he beheld within the priceless
jewels,—the ruby, the pearl, and the diamond,—joined
together in one setting of gold.</p>

<p>Nihál Chand closely examined the prize. Round
the ruby, in characters of surpassing fineness, were
engraved the words,—<i>Thy sins be forgiven thee</i> (Matt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ix. 2). Round the pearl, Purity, appeared the inscription,—<i>Holiness,
without which no man shall
see the Lord</i> (Heb. xii. 14). And in delicate letters
appeared round the diamond,—<i>It is your Father’s
good pleasure to give you the kingdom</i> (Luke
xii. 32).</p>

<p>Temptation looked with envy and desire on the
precious jewels in the hands of Nihál Chand, though
not yet worn over his heart. Much did Temptation
wish to rob of them the brave man who had come
through such difficulties to obtain them; but Nihál
Chand was courageous and strong, and Temptation
knew that he had not a chance of getting the jewels
by force. He therefore had recourse to cunning.</p>

<p>“The ornament is very beautiful,” said the treacherous
stranger, bending forward as if to examine it.
“Grand is the blood-red ruby, and happy is he to
whom free pardon for sin is given.”</p>

<p>Nihál Chand smiled as he made reply,—“Of great
value is the ruby; none but its possessor can know
real peace. Blessed is he whose sins are forgiven—he
who fears not the judgment of God.”</p>

<p>“And splendid is the diamond,” observed Temptation;
“Heaven is indeed such a prize as the
mightiest might glory in winning.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the exulting Nihál Chand,—who,
when he passed the waters of Baptism, had assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the new name of Christian; “it is a glorious thing to
be made an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven!”</p>

<p>“But, to my mind,” observed crafty Temptation,
“this pale pearl set between the ruby and the diamond
rather mars the beauty of the whole ornament.
The gift would be better without it.”</p>

<p>“Yet it adds to its value,” observed Nihál Chand;
“is not the health of the soul a thing to be prized?”</p>

<p>“Your health is most perfect,” said the crafty
deceiver; “he who carouses at a banquet cares not
to put medicine into his cup. Behold the strength
of your arm and the firmness of your step! You
need no health beyond what you already possess.
Look again at the jewel, my lord, and say whether
you would not prefer the glowing ruby Pardon, and
the sparkling diamond Heaven, apart from Purity
the white pearl?”</p>

<p>Nihál Chand looked again and again, and every
time that he looked he cared less for the pearl, though
this, as well as the other jewels, had been offered
to him by his Father.</p>

<p>Temptation now drew from his bosom a paper;
he opened it, and displayed to view a yellow stone,
which to the eyes of Nihál Chand looked very beautiful,
though, in truth, it was but a worthless bit of
coloured glass.</p>

<p>“My heart is so drawn towards your honour,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
crafty Temptation, “that I am willing to do for you
what I would do for no other man. I am willing
to exchange this precious yellow stone, of which the
name is Pleasure, for your dull, pale pearl, Purity.
I am of great experience in the art of setting stones;
give but your consent, O my lord, and the exchange
at once shall be made.”</p>

<p>Nihál Chand doubted and hesitated. In his secret
heart he preferred Pleasure to Purity; yet something
within him whispered that it would be both
foolish and wrong to part with any portion of the
gift of his Father.</p>

<p>When Temptation saw that the Christian Nihál
Chand hesitated, he knew that his own object was
half gained already. Temptation turned the false
stone, Pleasure, in every direction, so that the light
should sparkle upon it. Again, in terms of contempt,
he spoke of Purity, the pearl, as being only
fit for women to wear.</p>

<p>At last Nihál Chand was persuaded to change
the pearl for the bit of coloured glass. “Be careful,”
said he, “in removing the pearl, not to injure my
ruby or my diamond. I care not much for Purity
of heart; but Pardon for the past and Heaven for
the future are possessions with which I never will
part.”</p>

<p>O foolish boast! O worse than foolish deed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Scarcely had Nihál Chand trusted his treasure into
the hands of Temptation, ere the treachery of the
thief was made clear. The deceiver suddenly darted
down the hill, at such speed that the weary Nihál
Chand, startled and surprised, had no power to follow.
Very soon the deceiver, who had carried off
the priceless treasure, was lost to view.</p>

<p>With bitter shame and grief Nihál Chand now
returned on his steps, feeling like a lost and ruined
man. Oh that he had had but the wisdom to know
that purity of character, the health of the soul, is
never to be divided from pardon of sin and the promise
of heaven, so freely and lovingly offered by
God, the all-merciful Father! Christ came to save
us from the power as well as from the punishment
of our sins.</p>

<p class="tb">O reader, have you understood the meaning of
my parable, the lesson which is to the story even
what the kernel is to the nutshell?</p>

<p>Ask your own heart whether you yourself resemble
any one of the four men whose story you
now have heard. Have you, like Mulá Mal, refused
even to listen to the messenger who would bring
you good tidings of pardon and peace through Christ,
who came to seek and to save the lost? Will you
not even read the Scriptures, to see for yourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
whether the message be true? Do you stop your
ears and harden your heart when God’s servant
comes to tell you of pardon, purity, and heaven,
freely offered to man?</p>

<p>Or are you, like Biharí Lal, almost persuaded that
the good tidings are indeed true; and yet, are you
inclined to leave the matters that concern the soul
to a more convenient season? Are you setting your
heart on your merchandise or any worldly gains,
when Death, the black camel that kneels at every
man’s door, may even now, with noiseless tread, be
approaching yours? Alas! remember the Saviour’s
solemn warning,—<i>What shall it profit a man if he
gain the whole world and lose his own soul? or what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</i></p>

<p>Or are you, like Tulsí Rám, a sincere believer in
the gift of God, and one who heartily desires to obtain
pardon for sin, purity of heart, and heavenly
bliss when this short life shall be over? And yet,
do you lack courage to take the decisive step which
may cause your soul to be wounded by persecution,
the step which will perhaps divide you for ever from
all that on earth you hold most dear? Do you
think that you can keep back from Christian baptism,
and yet secure the Christian’s blessing? O
weak and trembling believer, forget not the words of
Christ the Lord,—<i>Whosoever shall confess Me before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
men, him shall the Son of man also confess before
the angels of God. Blessed are they that are persecuted
for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.</i></p>

<p>But you may be, O reader, one who has bravely
passed through the waters of Baptism—you may be
one who is now called by the name of Christian.
At the foot of the Cross you may have found the
treasure which is more precious than all besides.
You may have the knowledge of the way to eternal
life, you may believe in the Son of God, and you
may be resting your hopes of heaven upon His
finished work. But even now, oh, stand on your
guard, for Temptation is near! An enemy, even
Satan, is beside you, who would persuade you that
every one who has been baptized is safe, even if his
faith (<i>not living faith</i>) work no change in his life.
The man who is willing to divide purity from pardon
and heaven, will, like Nihál Chand, <i>lose all of the
three</i>! He who wilfully throws away the white
pearl, has lost the ruby and the diamond! For
thus saith the Holy Saviour, He who is Truth,
Righteousness, and Love,—<i>Not every one that saith
unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of
heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which
is in heaven</i>.</p>

<p>O reader, may God give to you grace to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Holy Scriptures in your right hand, and the staff of
Prayer in your left. May He so guide you by His
Holy Spirit, which is promised in answer to prayer,
that you may fearlessly and faithfully go on your
way, treading under foot the thorns that lie in your
path! And may He enable you not only to find,
but to hold fast to the end, and wear in your heart,
the priceless treasures—even free pardon for every
past sin, the promise of a heavenly crown, and that
purity of life by which every true Christian must
seek to glorify God!</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">Jewels Found.<br />
<span class="smaller">A SEQUEL TO THE STORY OF THREE JEWELS.</span></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">With a very heavy heart and sorrowful
countenance a man of the name of Tulsí
Rám sat in his dwelling. He found no
rest by night and no pleasure by day. His hookah<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
brought him no sense of repose. He cared not to
go forth to visit his friends. Tulsí Rám scarcely
touched the food placed before him by Juwalí his
wife.</p>

<p>The heart of the gentle Juwalí was very closely
knit to that of her husband. She was as the creeping
plant which throws its tendrils round the tall
tree; and as the leaves of the two are mingled
together, so until now had the thoughts and hopes
of Juwalí been mingled with those of Tulsí Rám.
Happy the man who has such a wife as Juwalí!</p>

<p>The gentle woman had long watched in silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the sorrow of her husband; she had sighed when
she heard him sigh, and grieved because she beheld
him grieve. At last Juwalí could keep silence no
longer.</p>

<p>“Why is my lord so sorrowful?” she said;
“why has sleep fled from his eyes? and wherefore
doth he put away food from him? To share the
troubles of my lord, would be to me a dearer privilege
than to enjoy all kinds of pleasures in an ivory
palace.”</p>

<p>Then Tulsí Rám opened his heart to his wife, for
he had none other in whom he could safely confide.
“Know, O Juwalí!” said he, “that some time since,
from beyond the dark water, there came a messenger
from my great Father, Kamíl Rahím,—that Father
whom I never have seen, but who loves me with
exceeding great love. This messenger, whose name
is Narayan Das, brought to me and to my three
brothers, Mulá Mal, Biharí Lal, and Nihál Chand,
the following message:—</p>

<p>“I bring to you, O brothers! good tidings from
your great and merciful Father, who ever careth for
His children. There is a treasure hidden for you
at the foot of a Cross, even jewels of priceless value,—a
ruby called Pardon, a pearl called Purity, and
a diamond called Heaven. The three jewels are
joined together in one setting of gold, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
must be divided one from another. He who wears
these jewels over his heart will have safety in
danger, perfect health, and become the heir to a
glorious throne. The treasure is a free gift from
your Father, and each one of you who shall seek
for it in the right way shall possess it for his
own.”</p>

<p>“These are wonderful tidings indeed!” exclaimed
Juwalí; “but did my lord and his brothers believe
them?”</p>

<p>“Mulá Mal would not believe,” replied Tulsí
Rám; “he would not so much as listen to Narayan
Das, or read the letter which the messenger had
brought to him from our Father;” and Tulsí Rám,
as he spoke, laid his hand on a book called the
Bible, which Juwalí had often heard him reading
aloud to himself. “Biharí Lal, on the contrary,
believed the brave and earnest man who had left
his native land, and come through trials and dangers,
to bring good tidings to us. But my second
brother’s heart was set on his merchandise and his
business, and he put off seeking for the treasure till
a more convenient season.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried Juwalí, “in the midst of all his
cares and his pleasures, poor Biharí Lal was smitten
by cholera, and he passed away from earth, even as
the rain sinks in the sand and is seen no more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I stood by the funeral-pile of Biharí
Lal,” said Tulsí Rám, “I resolved in my heart that
I would not delay searching for the treasure as my
poor brother had done. I girded myself and set
out on my journey. Great was my desire to wear
over my heart the jewels of Pardon, Purity, and
Heaven.”</p>

<p>Juwalí did not venture to ask, “And did my
lord find them?”—for she saw by the anguish
written on his face that Tulsí Rám had never
possessed the treasure.</p>

<p>“But I found the journey to be one of exceeding
difficulty,” continued Tulsí Rám with a sigh.
“To possess myself of the promised jewels, I had to
cross a river called Baptism, to pass which was to
break my caste; and I could not reach it without
descending, with much danger and pain, a very
steep bank. On this bank grows thickly that
plant with exceeding sharp thorns whose name is
Persecution, and briers whose names are Loss and
Contempt. Juwalí, I went some steps forward;
but then I stopped short, for I could not, I dared
not go further! The thorns and briers had torn
my garments and wounded my flesh. I groaned in
the anguish of my spirit. Great as was my longing
to possess Pardon, Purity, and Heaven, I could not
endure the suffering through which I must pass to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
win them. I turned back, O wretched man that
I am! I turned back;” and Tulsí Rám groaned
aloud.</p>

<p>Tears dropped from the eyes of Juwalí. She
had heard enough of the Father’s letter, from the
lips of her husband, to feel sure that the treasure
which he had lost was one of priceless value.
Juwalí had even, with great pains, learned to read
a little herself from the Book which her husband
prized, and she had thought much, by night and by
day, over what she had heard and read.</p>

<p>“What makes my shame and grief all the
greater,” continued Tulsí Rám after a pause, “is to
know that my brave and noble youngest brother,
Nihál Chand, has done what I dared not do. He
trampled down the thorns under his feet; he heeded
not the briers of Loss and Contempt; he pressed
on as a strong racer who seeth the goal near, and
already heareth the shouts of those who will behold
him lay his hand on the prize. He was as a hero
who flincheth not in the day of battle. Nihál
Chand burst through Persecution; he crossed the
waters of Baptism; and now, without doubt, he is
wearing the Father’s gift, all his sins pardoned, his
virtues shining forth in his life, and his spirit rejoicing
in hope of a crown to be worn for ever and
ever. I, on the contrary, a wretched coward, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bewail my weakness to the end of my days, and
shall at last perish without pardon, and sink into
outer darkness.”</p>

<p>Tulsí Rám smote his breast, for he felt as a
criminal who heareth the sentence of death. Then
Juwalí who sat at her husband’s feet, lifted up her
mild eyes and spake thus:—</p>

<p>“O my lord! surely it is not too late to do now
what Nihál Chand has done; it is not too late to
arise and go forth to seek the treasure. My lord
will take yon staff of Prayer in his hand, and with
it beat down some of the briers and thorns. It is
far better to have the flesh torn than the heart
broken; it is better to suffer for a short space than
to be wretched for ever.”</p>

<p>Tulsí Rám listened with some surprise to such
brave words from the lips of a woman. Then said
he, “Behold, I see <i>two</i> staffs of Prayer. Wherefore
should two be provided?”</p>

<p>Then Juwalí blushed and drooped her head, as in
a low voice she replied, “I, even I, am ready to go
with my lord.”</p>

<p>“Thou!” exclaimed the astonished husband.
“Canst thou, feeble woman, endure the thorns of
Persecution and the briers of Contempt? Hast
thou no regard for thy caste? Thou art weak, and
a stranger to the dangers of the world; thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ever been sheltered from all troubles, as the pearl
shut closely up in its shell.”</p>

<p>Juwalí grasped the staff, and said, though with a
trembling voice,—“I am weak, but I can lean hard
upon Prayer. As for troubles, will it not be a joy
to share them with my dear lord? Let all my
neighbours despise me, so that I be but fair in his
eyes. As regards caste, surely the highest caste of
all is to belong to the family of the Great King.
O my lord, let us set forth at once; let us cross the
river of Baptism together! I am but a woman;
but I have learned from that blessed Book that the
great Father loves His daughters as well as His sons;
and who knows whether even for me some gift may
not be reserved? Unworthy as I am even to look
upon them, may not I too, possibly, receive the
jewels of Pardon, Purity, and Heaven?”</p>

<p>Then Tulsí Rám, as from a sudden impulse,
sprang to his feet. “Shall a woman be ready to
leave all, and dare all, and suffer all,” he exclaimed;
“and shall a man shrink back like a coward! O
Juwalí, light of my eyes! thy voice is like the
voice of hope to thy husband. I will follow the
example of my brave brother; come what may, we
will cross the waters of Baptism.”</p>

<p>Very early in the following morning, before the
sun had risen, Tulsí Rám and Juwalí, each with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
staff of Prayer in hand, and the husband with the
Book in his bosom, started from their home and
commenced their journey. The earth was glowing
in the bright light of the sun before they reached
the top of the bank which overlooked the river of
Baptism. By this time the slender frame of Juwalí
was weary; but she leaned on her staff, and looked
now tenderly at the husband whose steps she followed,
now on the glorious sky above her. Juwalí
thought of Pardon, Purity, and Heaven, and then
she forgot her weariness. Till now Tulsí Rám had
walked on in front; but he stopped on the top of
the bank, and let his wife come up with him. He
feared that she would never have strength to pass
through the terrible thorns of Persecution. Tulsí’s
own heart was again failing him; but when he
looked sadly and anxiously at Juwalí, she met his
look with a smile.</p>

<p>“Wilt thou not wait and rest a while?” asked
the husband.</p>

<p>“Oh no; I am ready at once to go with my
lord,” replied Juwalí, so cheerfully that the soul of
Tulsí Rám was filled with wonder. Beholding the
courage of a woman, his own greatly revived.</p>

<p>Together the two began to descend the bank.
Tulsí Rám was so anxious about his wife that he
scarcely felt how the thorns were tearing his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
flesh. Never had Juwalí been so dear to the soul of
her husband as now, when, in a woman with weak
frame but brave spirit, he beheld his fellow-heir of
eternal life; no mere plaything or slave, but the
companion of his dangers, the sharer of all his trials.
Juwalí suffered even more than did her husband.
After the fashion of Indian women, Juwalí wore
many rings in her ears;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and the briers and thorns
caught in these rings, so that the wearer’s course
was stayed, and she was as a prisoner fastened in
bonds. Tears gushed from the woman’s eyes.
Tulsí Rám tried to lend his aid to release his wife,
but only himself became more painfully entangled
in the sharp thorns.</p>

<p>“O Juwalí! what can we do?” exclaimed Tulsí
Rám.</p>

<p>Juwalí’s answer was in her act. She lifted up
her small bleeding hands, and broke off one by one
the ear-rings which hindered her progress, and left
them hanging upon the thorns.</p>

<p>“See, I am free!” she cried, smiling, as Tulsí
Rám, by a desperate effort, also released himself
from the briers.</p>

<p>“Thou art losing thy jewels, O beloved!” said
the pitying husband.</p>

<p>“I seek better and brighter jewels,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Juwalí. “Shall I regret these baubles if I ever
possess the ruby of Pardon, the pearl of Purity, and
the diamond of Heaven?”</p>

<p>And so the two travellers reached at last the
bottom of the bank, panting, weary, pierced with
thorns, but still not seriously hurt. The waters
of Baptism flowed before Tulsí Rám and Juwalí.
Hand-in-hand the husband and wife passed through
those clear waters, the coolness of which afforded
to them wondrous refreshment. Tulsí Rám had
grasped the hand of his wife to help her across,
but Juwalí scarcely needed his help. When they
reached the opposite bank, Tulsí Rám looked at
Juwalí, and lo! never before had her face shone
with such heavenly beauty! It was even as the
brightness of the moon when the clouds have passed
away, and her silver light falls softly on earth.
And never to Tulsí Rám had Juwalí’s voice sounded
so sweet as when she exclaimed, “O lord of my
heart! the river is passed. Let us rejoice and give
thanks.”</p>

<p>The opposite bank was less steep, though still
made difficult of ascent by the thorns of Persecution.
But the spirit of Tulsí Rám had now acquired fresh
courage. Having once crossed the river which he
had dreaded, and having found in it nothing to
harm him, but only refreshment, Tulsí Rám felt all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
his strength return. Cheerfully he lent his aid to
the weary but happy Juwalí, and the two soon
stood at the top of the bank, from which their glad
eyes could see the Cross on the hill.</p>

<p>“Our treasure is yonder, and it will soon be
ours!” exclaimed Tulsí Rám.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered the words when he and
his wife were startled by the sound of a terrible
groan,—such a groan as is uttered only by one in
mortal anguish or pain.</p>

<p>“Look yonder, my lord,” cried Juwalí; “there is
a man lying beneath yon palm-tree. Perhaps he is
wounded or dying; hark to his terrible groans!”</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice the poor wretch half
raised himself from the ground, so that Tulsí Rám
could behold his face. Distorted by pain as was
that face, with what surprise and distress did Tulsí
Rám recognize in his features those of his brave
brother, Nihál Chand.</p>

<p>“Can it be! Yes, surely it is my own brother,”
exclaimed Tulsí Rám, hastening towards the spot.</p>

<p>It was indeed poor Nihál Chand who, in a state
of weakness and suffering, was lying under the tree.
He feebly held out his arms, and was soon in the
embrace of Tulsí Rám.</p>

<p>“What ails my brother?—he who is twice my
brother—for have we not both passed through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
waters of Baptism; are we not both Christians?”
cried Tulsí Rám,—“though you were a Christian
before me.” Christian is the new name given to
those who have passed through the river.</p>

<p>“Oh, call me not Christian!” exclaimed the
miserable Nihál Chand; “I am not worthy of the
name.”</p>

<p>“What has happened; what have you done?”
exclaimed Tulsí Rám with anxiety, for he saw that
the anguish of his brother was great.</p>

<p>It was some little time before Nihál Chand was
able to tell his sad story. His head drooped on his
breast with shame. His brother wondered that one
who had so bravely crossed the river of Baptism
should now appear so weak and wretched. At last
Tulsí Rám inquired, “Could my brother not find
the jewels, the gift of our Father,—even the ruby,
the pearl, and the diamond?”</p>

<p>“I found them; yes, I found them,” groaned
Nihál Chand, “but I never wore them over my
heart, and now I have lost them for ever—for ever!”
Then the stream of his grief found vent in words,
and to the listening Tulsí Rám and Juwalí Nihál
Chand thus poured forth the tale of his sorrow and
sin:—</p>

<p>“I had not long passed the river of Baptism
when I was joined by a stranger, dark in face, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wearing gaudy attire, and of a smooth and flattering
tongue.”</p>

<p>“Methinks I know him,” said Tulsí Rám;
“surely his name is Temptation.”</p>

<p>“He walked by my side,” continued Nihál Chand,
“praising my courage and zeal, till my heart was
lifted up with pride, and I thought that nothing
but success and glory could be before me. I reached
the foot of the Cross; there I found, according to
the words of my Father’s messenger, a precious
golden casket. On opening it, I found within a
beauteous ornament,—even the magnificent jewels
joined together in one setting of gold. Over the
ruby, Pardon, were inscribed the words, <i>Thy sins be
forgiven thee</i>. Round the pearl, Purity, appeared
engraved, <i>Holiness, without which no man shall see
the Lord</i>. And I beheld written round the glittering
diamond, <i>It is your Father’s good pleasure to
give you the kingdom</i>. Never was there an ornament
so precious or so beautiful as this free gift
from our Father.”</p>

<p>The eyes of Juwalí sparkled at the description
given by Nihál Chand. Tulsí Rám inquired,—“Why
did you not at once, O my brother, place the
treasure upon your heart?”</p>

<p>“Because of the words of Temptation, treacherous
Temptation!” exclaimed the miserable Nihál Chand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“He persuaded me that though Pardon is a precious
gift, and Heaven a prize that the mightiest rajah
might covet, yet that the pale pearl, Purity, was
what few would desire to wear. Temptation offered
me in its stead a yellow stone, which he said was of
greater value, and to which he gave the name of
Pleasure. Woe is me! woe is me! that ever I listened
to the voice of Temptation, that I ever was
persuaded to part with my pearl for that which
afterwards broke in my hands, as a piece of worthless
glass! I thought that I could give away Purity
and yet keep Pardon and Heaven. I let Temptation
take my treasure into his hand, that he might separate
the pearl from the ruby and diamond. But
the three may never be divided. Temptation, taking
advantage of my worse than folly, rushed suddenly
away whither I had no power to follow him,
bearing with him all that I had dared so much to
win.”</p>

<p>“Leaving nothing with you!” cried Tulsí Rám.</p>

<p>“Leaving remorse and shame, and a wretched
imitation of a jewel, called Pleasure, which I found
to be utterly worthless. Nor have you heard the
end of my story. I wandered about for a while,
unwilling to remain by the Cross, yet more unwilling
to return to the city which I had left with such
bright hopes and brave resolutions. At last I laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
me down to sleep, but from that sleep I was startled
by a sharp pain. The venomous reptile whose name
is <i>Uljhánewale gunah</i><a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> had noiselessly crept towards
me and inflicted this wound in my breast;”
and raising his mantle, Nihál Chand showed a dark
spot, which marked where the reptile’s fang had left
its deadly poison.</p>

<p>Tulsí Rám and Juwalí beheld the wound with
grief and alarm.</p>

<p>“O Nihál!” exclaimed the brother, “I know
too well what are the effects of the bite of the
<i>Uljhánewale gunah</i>. No serpent is more to be
dreaded. The remedy is at once to cut out the
wounded part. This must be done, and at once.”
And Tulsí Rám drew forth a sharp knife which he
carried in his girdle. On the handle of that knife
was engraved its name—<i>Help from above</i>.</p>

<p>Nihál Chand was a brave man, and yet, strange
to say, he shrank like a child from the pain which
his brother thought it needful to inflict. “No, no!”
he cried, with an impatient movement of the hand;
“such sharp remedies are not required. Do not the
healing leaves of Good Intentions grow abundantly
in yon thicket? It will suffice to lay them upon the
wound; they will soon draw all its poison away.”</p>

<p>Tulsí Rám, distressed and anxious, took out hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from his bosom his Father’s letter, and quickly
turned over the pages, to find if it gave any directions
for the treatment of a case like that of his
brother. Very grave was his face, and earnest his
tones, as he read aloud the words of Him who is
truth itself: <i>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it
is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than
having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that
shall never be quenched: where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quenched.</i></p>

<p>“What is the meaning of those terrible words?”
inquired Nihál Chand, who trembled to hear them.</p>

<p>“O brother! the meaning is clear,” cried Tulsí
Rám. “Whatever be the anguish which it may
cost, by the means of <i>Help from above</i> we must
part from and cast from us whatever is tainted by
the poison of sin. You can never have health, never
have peace, nay, your very life is in imminent peril,
unless whatever has been poisoned by the <i>Uljhánewale
gunah</i> be instantly and thoroughly cut away.”</p>

<p>Poor unhappy Nihál Chand looked like one in
despair. Even the lightest touch on the poisoned
place gave him pain; how could he then endure
suffering which the knife would inflict?</p>

<p>Juwalí had taken the Book from the hand of her
husband, and now, with a trembling voice, read this
sentence aloud: <i>Let the wicked forsake his way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return
unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him,
and unto our God, for He will abundantly pardon.</i></p>

<p>The words were words of hope, and from hope some
courage came back to the heart of Nihál Chand.
“I will submit,” he said; “and if I suffer, I suffer
but according to my deserts.”</p>

<p>Silently but sadly Nihál Chand endured the needful
anguish; the part poisoned by the serpent was
cut away, while Juwalí, on her knees, wept and
prayed for her erring brother.</p>

<p>“Now, O Nihál! you have parted with that
which kept you from peace,” said the faithful Tulsí
Rám, whose heart had bled for the sinner even
while, with <i>Help from above</i>, he had inflicted the
pain; “now once more you may hope to possess our
Father’s gift of Pardon, Purity, and Heaven.”</p>

<p>“Never!” groaned Nihál Chand. “When I
yielded to Temptation, when I gave up my threefold
treasure, it was lost to me past recovery. Go on,
ye happy ones! for the treasure may still be yours;
but as for me, I shall carry a scar on my breast, and
a deep wound in my heart, to my grave.”</p>

<p>Nihál Chand closed his eyes, for he was too faint
and too much exhausted to speak more, far less to
proceed on his way. The souls of Tulsí Rám and
Juwalí were full of compassion for him who so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
bitterly repented having given way to Temptation,
and who so mourned over the disgrace which he
had brought on the name of Christian. Tulsí Rám
resolved to remain for a while by his brother, till
Nihál Chand should be refreshed by a little rest.
Juwalí, at her husband’s desire, retired to the distance
of a few paces, leaving the brothers together.
There Juwalí knelt down and prayed for her husband,
and for herself, and for the penitent Nihál
Chand. Then, being very weary, Juwalí dropped
asleep at the foot of a banyan-tree.</p>

<p>In vain Tulsí Rám strove to give comfort and
hope to his younger brother; in vain he spoke of
the mercy freely offered to all who repent and cast
away sin. Though the poisoned part, by means of
<i>Help from above</i>, had been cut away from the
breast of Nihál Chand, a painful wound yet remained,
nor could he forget the past.</p>

<p>“Oh! that I had resisted Temptation,” he cried;
“oh! that I had pressed to my heart the jewels of
Pardon, Purity, and Heaven; the poisonous reptile
would have lost all power to injure me then.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Nihál Chand was sinking deeper and deeper into
despair, when Juwalí, having arisen from sleep, advanced
towards the brothers with radiant joy sparkling
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“O my lord,” she exclaimed, addressing herself
to her husband, “I have been sent in my sleep
a strange and beautiful dream. Behold, I saw
Temptation, the dark enemy, the robber of souls,
hurrying away with the jewels of my lord’s brother
in his grasp,—even the ruby, the pearl, and the diamond
joined in one setting of gold. Suddenly a
white dove swooped down from the sky, and caught
the jewels out of the evil one’s hand, and bore them
away out of sight. Then I heard a voice, sweeter than
music; and these were the words which it uttered:
‘Let the penitent who sorrows for sin, let the penitent
who hath put away sin, again search for his forfeited
treasure, and he shall find it once more, where he
sought for it at first, even at the foot of the Cross.”</p>

<p>The first gleam of hope that had appeared on the
face of the wounded Nihál Chand brightened it as
he listened to the account of the dream of his sister.
Leaning heavily, very heavily, on a staff of Prayer,
he struggled to his feet, and in a voice faint yet
resolute he said,—“Let us go, and at once. If I,
poor wounded sinner, must die, I will at least die at
the foot of the Cross!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Onwards the three Christians sped together.
There was small difficulty to Tulsí Rám, with his
knife, <i>Help from above</i>, in removing the earth which
covered a golden casket. The Christian eagerly
raised and opened it, and Juwalí uttered an exclamation
of delight as she looked on its contents. There
lay three splendid ornaments, each containing three
matchless jewels, worth more than all the crowns of
the world,—even the ruby of Pardon, the pearl of
Purity, and the diamond of Heaven!</p>

<p>On his knees, and with head bowed down, as
deeply feeling how unworthy he was of his Father’s
gift, Nihál Chand received his restored treasure, and
pressed it first to his lips and then to his wounded
breast. But no sooner had the jewels been placed
near his heart than, to his amazement as well as
delight, new health and strength were poured into
his frame. Nihál Chand’s wound became perfectly
healed, and, springing to his feet, he again stood
erect, a brave and rejoicing man; a Christian strong
to wrestle against Temptation, and overcome it
wherever he should meet it again.</p>

<p>And, like Nihál Chand, Tulsí Rám and his much
loved wife, Juwalí, the faithful and meek, wore over
their hearts for ever the ruby, the pearl, and the
diamond, their sins all pardoned, and their lives
made pure. Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
continuing instant in prayer, the three Christians
looked forward to the glorious time when,
having been faithful unto death, they should receive
the crown of life which the Lord hath promised to
them that love him.</p>

<p class="tb">O reader! in this story have you read anything
of your own? You may have crossed the waters of
baptism, you may have received the name of Christian,
but have you yielded to temptation, is the
venom of the reptile, besetting sin, whether pride,
or falsehood, or the love of money, at this moment
poisoning your soul? Oh! cut away and cast the
evil from you, by means of help from above, or you
will surely perish in your sin. Even for your wound
there is healing, even for your guilt there is pardon;
the pearl of purity may yet be yours, you may yet
inherit the kingdom of heaven. <i>The blood of Jesus
Christ cleanseth from all sin</i>; the Holy Spirit is
given in answer to prayer. But oh, delay not! for
time is short, the day of grace may soon be past.
It is the penitent sinner, the faithful and the persevering,
who at the foot of the cross shall find the
priceless treasures—the ruby, the pearl, and the
diamond—Pardon, Purity and Heaven!</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">The Broken Fence.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">On a high hill, in a mountainous part of
the Punjaub, was built a house goodly
and fair. In this dwelt a lady, whose
name was Ashley Sahiba. In her heart was much
love to God, and much love for poor little Indian
children. Under the care of this lady were many
girls; some of them were orphans, and some of them
had parents who lived in the plains, and who wished
their children to enjoy the cooler air of the hills.
These parents were glad to have their daughters
under the care of Ashley Sahiba, who would not
only teach them to read and write and work, but
who would also try to teach them to be gentle,
obedient, and pious.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Ashley Sahiba prayed much
with the children and for the children, and there
was not one of the girls who had not a place in her
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was one of the girls who was a cause
of much trouble and sorrow to the lady. The name
of this girl was Ghuldasta. There were two things
in her that occasioned this trouble and sorrow.
The first thing was that Ghuldasta had a strange
kind of blindness. She could see, and see well,
every object that was but a few inches from her,
so that she could read, and write, and sew,—and
she did these things as well as any other girl in the
school; but Ghuldasta could see nothing at even a
foot’s distance from her eyes. The girl never saw
the path before her, and therefore often stumbled
over things that lay in her way, and had many
painful falls; for Ghuldasta scorned a careful walk,
and never asked for a guide. Ghuldasta had a little
ivory box of precious ointment which had been sent
to her by her Father, and which, by his command,
she always carried in her bosom. “Let my child
carefully anoint her eyes with this ointment,” the
wise Father had said, “and she will soon see quite
clearly, so that she will not so stumble and fall.”
Ghuldasta had the ointment always within her reach,
but, strange to say, she never cared to use it at all;
she contented herself with looking at the outside
of the box, on the lid of which was written the
name of the ointment—<i>Self-examination mixed with
Prayer</i>; whilst round the edge appeared the words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
<i>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith;
prove your own selves</i> (2 Cor. xiii. 5). Ghuldasta
had heard that the ointment would make the eyes
smart, and she never would put it on hers. “I can
see quite well enough,” she would say; “no one
can read the Bible better than I; why should I
trouble myself with this Self-examination? It
would be of no use to me; and I dislike it of all
things.”</p>

<p>After hearing that Ghuldasta thus disobeyed her
wise Father’s commands, no one can be surprised at
being told the second cause of Ashley Sahiba’s sorrow
concerning the girl. Ghuldasta was much under the
power of two wicked spirits, whose names are Pride
and Self-will.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> She never saw them because of her
blindness. If she could have seen them, she would
have been frightened, for what is so hideous as sin?
But Ghuldasta often heard their voices, and, alas!
to her those voices were pleasant. Ashley Sahiba
more than suspected that these wicked spirits had
power over her young charge; for, though she could
not actually see or hear them, she saw the effect
which their company had on the unhappy Ghuldasta.
Often did Ashley Sahiba warn all her children: “O
my beloved ones! beware of Pride and Self-will, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
often steal upon us to mislead and destroy. They
are sent by the great Enemy, who wishes to ruin
our souls.” But though so often tenderly warned,
blind and foolish Ghuldasta was not in the least afraid
of listening to Pride and Self-will.</p>

<p>I have said that the house in which the lady and
children dwelt was built on the top of a high hill.
The house had pleasant grounds around it, in which
the children could play. All round this enclosure
was a fence made of stakes of the choicest wood.
This fence was very needful, as the hill was in some
parts so steep as to be dangerous, and the children
might often have fallen down precipices but for this
protection. On every one of the stakes was inscribed
in golden letters a precious text, which glittered
brightly in the sun, so that the fence was an ornament
to the place, as well as a safeguard to the
children. The name of the fence was Duty.</p>

<p>Some of the children were exceedingly glad that
there was this beautiful fence around the enclosure.
“There are many wild beasts in the mountains,”
they said; “cheetahs, and bears, and the terrible
lion called Shaitán, who goeth about seeking whom
he may devour. But for this fence we should never
feel safe. We never wish to venture beyond it.”</p>

<p>But Ghuldasta was not one of these children.
She had always a great desire to wander beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
this fence; and often and often did Pride and Self-will
urge her to do so.</p>

<p>Said Pride: “You have nothing to fear. What
do you care for cheetahs or lions?”</p>

<p>Whispered Self-will: “It is very hard to be shut
up in a small enclosure like this. Outside, on the
mountains, are many beautiful flowers and delicious
fruits. When you are close to them, you will see
and enjoy them; you will make wreaths for your
hair of the flowers, you will feast at your ease on
the fruits.”</p>

<p>Then added Pride: “Could not a brave and
resolute girl such as you are manage to get through
the fence?”</p>

<p>It is very dangerous to listen to Pride and Self-will,
the black serpents that speak now as the serpent
spake to Eve in the Garden of Eden. Ghuldasta
began to think in her heart, “Can I not contrive to
break down or pull up a little bit of the fence, just
enough to let me squeeze myself through the opening?”
Evil thinking soon leads to evil doing.</p>

<p>There was one particular spot in the enclosure,
shaded from view by thick bushes, to which Ghuldasta
now often wandered. She never asked any of
her companions to go with her thither. “I would
rather,” she said, “be alone.” Who would have
guessed what the foolish and sinful girl was doing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
when she spent the greater part of her leisure time
in this solitary retreat? Ghuldasta was, with a
knife, day by day cutting away at two of the stakes
of the beautiful fence. On one of these stakes
was written: <i>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves
unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one
to another, and be clothed with humility</i> (1 Peter
v. 5). And on the second stake was written: <i>Obey
them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
for they watch for your souls, as they that
must give account</i> (Heb. xiii. 17). Ghuldasta did
not care to read the holy words inscribed on the
stakes; her only anxiety was to get rid of whatever
hindered her going whither Pride and Self-will made
her eager to go. And, alas! all those days during
which Ghuldasta was cutting and doing her utmost
to destroy the holy fence, she, with the other girls,
regularly read the Bible, sang hymns, and knelt down
to pray. While she was obeying Pride and Self-will,
and neglecting her Father’s commands, every
prayer and hymn from this girl’s lips was in itself a
grievous sin.</p>

<p>Very early one morning, before the rest of the
girls had come forth into the grounds, Ghuldasta
finished her wicked work. She had cut so very
deep into each of the two stakes in the fence of Duty,
that she was now able to snap them off altogether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and fling them far away down the mountain. She
then tried to squeeze herself through the gap which
she had made, and easily enough succeeded in doing
so; for, alas! wilful sinners have no difficulty in
passing beyond the fence of Duty, when once they
have broken the holy commands which form it.</p>

<p>Ghuldasta was rejoicing in the thought that now
she could wander whither she would, with none to
restrain her, when suddenly she felt a firm grasp on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Wretched, blind girl!” exclaimed a voice behind
her, “whither are you going?” The voice was that
of Ashley Sahiba.</p>

<p>Ghuldasta could not see the look of sorrow on the
face of her guardian, any more than she could behold
the love and pity in her heart; the girl only heard
that the sound of the voice was angry, and felt that
the grasp of the hand was a tight one.</p>

<p>“Wrench yourself away!” cried Self-will.</p>

<p>“How can she speak in so harsh a tone? How dare
she call you wretched and blind?” exclaimed Pride.</p>

<p>Ghuldasta was not strong enough to wrench herself
away; but as soon as the lady had drawn her
back through the gap in the fence, the girl flung
herself on the ground in a terribly sulky fit. She
would scarcely listen to the lady’s earnest words of
warning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“How unkind she is!” cried Self-will.</p>

<p>“How unjust she is!” muttered Pride.</p>

<p>It is sad to relate how completely these evil
spirits held Ghuldasta in subjection. The girl was
in a fit of ill-humour, and showed it in every way
that she possibly could. She would not eat, she
would not work; she behaved as if she thought
that her tender friend had done her a cruel wrong
in drawing her back from a perilous path. Ghuldasta
was miserable herself, and tried to make all
around her unhappy also. And yet this girl never
looked upon herself as a grievous sinner. She had
not anointed her eyes with the precious ointment
contained in the ivory box.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” thought Ashley Sahiba:
“how shall I prevent my wilful, blind lamb from
wandering in ways of destruction? She has broken
down part of the fence; we cannot, with so many
other children to care for, watch her night and day.
I dread lest she should again attempt to escape and
wander on the mountains, where there are precipices
and rushing torrents, and where wild beasts roam
about seeking for prey.”</p>

<p>After anxious thought Ashley Sahiba had the gap
in the fence filled up by a quantity of sharp prickly
thorns of which the name is Punishment. “Now
I trust that my child will be safe,” thought she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>On the first opportunity the wilful Ghuldasta
found her way back to the spot where she had
broken a way through the fence; but when she attempted
to pass through the gap, lo! sharp Punishment
stayed her.</p>

<p>“Cruel, cruel Mem Sahiba!” exclaimed Ghuldasta,
as she drew back her bleeding hand, which
had been hurt by the thorns.</p>

<p>“She shall never stop you in this way!” cried
Self-will.</p>

<p>“She finds fault with you because she does not
love you as she loves the other girls,” muttered
Pride. “She is hard, partial, and unjust.”</p>

<p>Ghuldasta resolved that even Punishment should
not stop her. She remained all the rest of that day
sulky and silent, revolving in her mind by what
means she could still get her own way. Even during
prayer-time all the thoughts of the sinful girl
were turned in this direction. While the Mem
Sahiba was reading the Bible aloud to her children,
Ghuldasta was listening to the whispers of
Pride and Self-will, which none could hear but herself.</p>

<p>Said Pride: “When none are near to watch you,
take the thick black rug of Obstinacy and throw it
right over the thorns. They may hurt you a little
still, but they will not be able to stay you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will not care for a little pain, so that you
get your own way,” cried Self-will.</p>

<p>When the house was hushed in silence,—when
all the other girls were sleeping, and the weary
Ashley Sahiba had closed her eyes in repose,—Ghuldasta
silently arose from her bed, and felt her
way to the place where hung the black rug. Bearing
Obstinacy with her, and moving as stealthily as
if she were a thief, the wilful girl contrived to quit
the house and reach the spot to which she so often
had turned her steps before. Ghuldasta flung the
rug of Obstinacy over the thorns of Punishment,
and found that by means of it she could manage
to clamber over, though not without some pain.
Ghuldasta was so much delighted at this, that almost
unconsciously she began to sing, though in a tone
too low to rouse any of the sleepers in the house,
which was at some distance. Ghuldasta—O fearful
mockery!—was actually humming a hymn when
she passed beyond the fence of Duty. She had on
her lips:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“There is a happy land,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Far, far away.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But she was not to have time to sing about the
“saints,” whose glory, if she went on in her wilful
course, she never, never would share. Ghuldasta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
though she knew it not, was on the path that
leadeth to destruction. She had no right to sing
of that happy land, from which she was actually
trying to shut herself out for ever.</p>

<p>I have said that Ghuldasta was apt to walk carelessly,
and that she was so near-sighted that, even
in the light of day, she could not see the path before
her. Suddenly, to her horror, the poor girl found
herself plunging down a precipice! Screaming for
help, Ghuldasta caught at the bushes to save herself:
they somewhat broke but they could not prevent
her fall; for the twigs gave way in her hand!
Down—down—down,—crashing fell the miserable
child! What would she not have given to have
felt the firm grasp of her Mem Sahiba! what would
she not have given to have been held fast by the
thorns of Punishment!—anything, anything that
might have saved her from the consequences of her
own blind folly!</p>

<p>Poor Ghuldasta was senseless before she reached
the bottom. Her clothes were rent; her body
bruised and bleeding; much of her hair had been
left on the bushes. After a while she came to herself,
in terrible pain, and with perfect darkness
around her. As Ghuldasta could only see objects
very, very near her, it was now to her as if she lay
at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where am I?” faintly murmured the miserable
girl. Gradually she remembered all that had happened;
but memory was anguish. Her best friend,
her much-wronged friend, was, she doubted not,
sleeping, all unconscious of the misery and danger of
the ungrateful girl whom she had warned in vain.
Ghuldasta’s young companions were slumbering in
peace, till the morning’s light should awaken them
to begin the occupations of the day. But for her
own pride and wilfulness, Ghuldasta might at that
moment have been safe and happy amongst them.</p>

<p>Ghuldasta longed to know where she was—to be
able to look around her. She thought of her ivory
box of ointment, which she still carried in her
bosom. Ghuldasta could not move her arm without
pain, and she knew well that the ointment would
make her eyes smart; but lying as she was in helplessness
and darkness in a strange place, for the first
time the girl wished to obey her Father’s command.</p>

<p>Ghuldasta anointed her eyes with the salve of
<i>Self-examination mixed with Prayer</i>, and the
effect of that salve was marvellous beyond all expectation.
At once perfect sight appeared to be
restored; Ghuldasta saw everything around her
bathed in the light of a clear full moon.</p>

<p>But it was a terrible view that was presented to
the wilful transgressor. She saw her danger—she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
saw her sin. Above her was a rude jagged cliff,
which, even had she been unhurt by her fall,
she could never have power to climb. Ghuldasta
lay upon thorns more painful than the thorns of
Punishment which she had thought so cruel, and
from these thorns she could not wrench herself free.</p>

<p>“Oh! what shall I do!—what shall I do!”
exclaimed the unhappy and penitent girl, after she
had exhausted herself by cries for help which no one
could hear. “Would that I had never listened to
the voices of the tempters!—would that I had never
broken through the fence of Duty, and left my safe and
happy home! I chose my own way; and a way of
misery I have found it. I was lifted up with pride,
and now I have fallen into the depths of despair!”</p>

<p>Ghuldasta could distinguish objects lying at no
great distance from her, which she at once recognized;
for on them golden letters were faintly glimmering
in the moonlight. These were the stakes
from the fence of Duty which she had herself broken
and flung away!</p>

<p>“<i>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto
the elder</i>,” faintly murmured Ghuldasta, as tears
flowed fast down her cheeks. “Alas! <i>I</i> would
never submit; I was never clothed in humility; I
would not obey her whom my Father had placed
over me; I was insolent to her in my manner, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
despised her wise commands, I abused her patience,
I grieved her heart. I shall never, never see her
again. Oh! will she ever give a sorrowful thought
to her poor Ghuldasta! No, no; she will be happy
with those who love her—those who obey her. I
shall soon be forgotten by all. Even in heaven
they will never meet, nor even miss, the wretched
Ghuldasta!” At the miserable thought, the poor
girl cried as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>Hark! what was that fearful sound in the distance?
Was it not the roar of the lion who goeth
about seeking whom he may devour? Ghuldasta
could not fight, and she could not flee. She was
ready to faint with terror. Then in her agony the
repentant sinner betook herself to prayer. Never,
never had poor Ghuldasta prayed before as she
prayed on that night, with clasped hands and
streaming eyes! Her supplications were no mockery
now—they came from a broken and contrite heart.</p>

<p>Ashley Sahiba, meanwhile, lay asleep on her bed;
but even in sleep her mind was restless. Thoughts
of her self-willed, proud Ghuldasta mixed themselves
with her dreams. At last the lady suddenly awoke,
for it seemed as if a voice were whispering in her ears:
“O shepherdess! where is your poor lost lamb?”</p>

<p>Ashley Sahiba closed her tired eyes, and tried to
go to sleep again, but she could not; she was so unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
about Ghuldasta. Presently she arose, and
knelt down and prayed for the child. Then softly
moving along the rows of beds on which the children
were sleeping, the lady sought that of Ghuldasta,
and started to find it empty! Her fears were
but too well-founded—Ghuldasta had fled! That
moment was one of the most painful which the lady
had ever known in the course of her life.</p>

<p>Ghuldasta, imprisoned by thorns, and sorely hurt
by her fall, lay straining her eyes to catch sounds
in the distance, and exhausted her little remaining
strength by weeping. At last, to her exceeding
terror, she saw the bushes on the cliff above her
moving, as if some large animal were forcing its way
down the difficult descent. She expected every
moment to see the glaring eyes of a beast of prey;
she became silent in the extremity of her fear.
Then, from the very spot from whence Ghuldasta
expected to hear a savage growl, came a dear and
well-known voice: “My child! my child! where
are you?” Ghuldasta, collecting all her strength,
called out the name of her lady; and a glad voice
answered from above. Heedless of weariness or
danger, Ashley Sahiba, by help of the bushes, was
clambering down the cliff from the top of which
Ghuldasta had fallen. The lady was like the good
shepherd seeking the straying sheep; like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
woman searching for the lost piece of silver; and
when at last she clasped her Ghuldasta in her arms,
her cry of joy was like that of the prodigal’s father:
<i>This my son was dead and is alive again; was lost,
and is found</i>.</p>

<p>Ashley Sahiba was followed by servants whom
she had roused to help in the search for Ghuldasta,
and who had made their way down the hill by a
longer but less dangerous path. The poor girl,
clinging to her Mem Sahiba, was raised from her
painful position, and carried up on a litter, for she
was unable to walk.</p>

<p>A fever succeeded, caused by the sufferings both
of mind and body endured on that night by Ghuldasta.
Under careful nursing she recovered from
the fever, but the poor girl carried on her to her
dying day marks of her terrible fall, and the remembrance
of it was never effaced from her mind. But
happy was it for Ghuldasta that she had learned to
anoint her eyes with the salve of <i>Self-examination
mixed with Prayer</i>; happy was it for her that she
could say, <i>Whereas I was blind, now I see</i>. Ghuldasta
had parted company with Pride and Self-will;
she became daily more meek and lowly, more like
Him who, though God as well as man, deigned in
His youth to be subject to a mortal mother. Ghuldasta
became the joy and crown of the faithful friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to whom she so long had been a cause of trouble
and sorrow. That friend taught her where alone
she could find forgiveness for all her past sins, and
grace to struggle against them in the future. <i>Blessed
are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven</i> (Matt. v. 4, 3).</p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">Shining in the Dark.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">There dwelt in the Punjaub a man of the
name of Bál Mukand, who was very
learned and clever. He had read many
hooks, Hindu, Sanscrit, and Arabic, the Vedas and
the Puránas; he had also read translations of many
of the writings of the English.</p>

<p>Bál Mukand entered the shop of Shib Das, the
goldsmith, and sat down beside him. Shib Das
had lost many friends because he had become a
Christian, but he had not lost the friendship
of Bál Mukand. “I will not quarrel with a
man because he wears not on his head a pugree
(turban) of the same colour as mine, or because
he has not the same thoughts in his head as I
have,” said the liberal-minded Punjaubi. He had
read and reflected too much to act the part of a
bigot.</p>

<p>And what were the thoughts of Bál Mukand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the subject of religion? Thus he expressed them to
Shib Das as he sat in his shop.</p>

<p>“I will never be a Christian!” said he. “Excepting
yourself, O Shib Das, I think that of all
people Christians are the worst.”</p>

<p>“And why do you think so?” inquired Shib Das.</p>

<p>“I have read the Koran and the Shastras, I have
read the Vedas and the Bible,” replied Bál Mukand,
“and I compare the books with the people who severally
profess to make such various writings the rule
of their faith. The Mohammedan is commanded to
fast in the Ramadan, and he fasts; he is commanded
to pray five times a day, and he prays.
The Hindu is told to reverence the Brahman; and
lo! he is ready to drink the water in which the
holy man’s feet have been washed. The Hindu
makes pilgrimages and visits temples, performs ablutions,
and will rather starve than eat that which he
deems unclean.”</p>

<p>“True, O Bál Mukand,” replied Shib Das; “but
why call Christians the worst of men? If they
make not pilgrimages nor observe long fasts, it is
because their religion does not command them to do
these things.”</p>

<p>“But their religion does command them to do
many things which they do not,” exclaimed Bál
Mukand with a sneer. “I have read their Bible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and know what is in it, and very good words they
are. The Bible says, <i>Love one another</i>; and how
many Christians hate one another instead! The
Bible says, <i>Thou shalt not covet</i>; and where is the
Christian who is not greedy of gain? The Christians
read in their Book that God is truth, they call
themselves His children; and yet how many tell lies!
The Mohammedan obeys his Koran, and the Hindu
follows the rules of his Vedas; but the Christian
reads his holy Book, and obeys not. When his guide
bids him take the narrow path, he rushes off to the
broad one. Therefore, I repeat again, Christians
are the worst of all men.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>“You are somewhat unjust to them,” observed
Shib Das. “Not all Christians act in the manner
which you describe.”</p>

<p>“Look at the Sahib log” (English), exclaimed
Bál Mukand; “they who think that they walk in
light, while all the rest of mankind lie in darkness!
See the Commissioner Sahib—has he not read in his
Book, <i>Be pitiful, be courteous</i>; and yet he spurns
natives from him as if they were no better than
dogs! Who is more fond of the world and of
money than the Railway Sahib; and look how some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of the English soldiers drink, though it is written
in their Bible that drunkards shall not inherit the
kingdom of heaven! Their religion may be pure as
rain from the sky, or stream from the mountain, but
wherein are they the better for it?”</p>

<p>Then Shib Das thoughtfully stroked his beard
and made reply: “If fruit grow not on the stone,
is it the fault of the rain? if the traveller stoop not
to drink of the stream beside him, is it the fault of
the river if he perish of thirst? I repeat again that
all Christians are not so disobedient to the laws of
their Book; there are some whose souls are as a
well-watered garden, in which grow the fruits of
holiness, truth, and love.”</p>

<p>“These people are very few,” muttered Bál
Mukand; “I could count on my fingers all whom
I have met with. As by far the greater number of
Christians are evil, where is the advantage of becoming
a Christian?”</p>

<p>Shib Das smiled and said: “O Bál Mukand, did
you ever hear the tradition of King Solomon and
the Queen of Sheba?”</p>

<p>Then said Bál Mukand, “I pray you tell me the
story.”</p>

<p>“It is said that the Queen of Sheba, who came
from afar to hear the wisdom of Solomon, tried thus
to put it to proof. She had flowers made by skilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
workmen so like real flowers, that no man, without
touching them, could tell the difference between
them. The queen showed to Solomon a quantity
of true and false flowers mixed together. ‘Let your
wisdom,’ said she, ‘discover, without coming near
them, which of the flowers have drank heaven’s
dews and which have not,—which are living and
which are lifeless.’”</p>

<p>“And what did the wise Solomon?” inquired
Bál Mukand.</p>

<p>“He commanded all the doors to be flung wide
open, so that the bees and other insects had free
access to the flowers. The bees settled on the blossoms
that had life, those in which heaven’s dew had turned
into honey. ‘Behold, O Queen,’ cried Solomon,
‘where there is life there is sweetness also. There
are many false flowers yonder, but we soon discover
the true.’ Even so, O Bál Mukand, there are
many that are called Christians who are not Christians
at all, for in their faith there is no life; they
have nothing of Christianity but the name. Would
Solomon have been a wise man had he said at once,
‘All these flowers are false’? No; he put the
matter to the proof. When you condemn all Christians
together, you have not the wisdom of Solomon
nor the discrimination of the bees. Besides,” added
Shib Das, “whatever the conduct of so-called Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
may be, you acknowledge that their religion is
pure, that their Book is good. Christians may be
faulty, but Christ Himself is perfect.”</p>

<p>“One looks for the disciples to be as the Master,”
observed Bál Mukand. “The Christian’s heaven
may exist, and be all that the Bible describes it to
be; but to me the path to it is so dark, that after
all my reading, and searching, and thinking, I own
that I cannot find it. I never shall be a Christian.”</p>

<p>Shib Das saw that there was no use in arguing
with one who refused to be convinced; therefore
the Christian remained silent. And soon afterwards
Bál Mukand fell asleep.</p>

<p>Bál Mukand was before long awakened by the
sound of some one speaking at the front of the shop,
but he stirred not, nor opened his eyes; he remained
as if sleeping still, and listened unnoticed to the
discourse of Shib Das with the stranger, whose name
was Karm Illahi.</p>

<p>There was in the shop a scimitar with a jewelled
hilt, which had attracted the eyes of Karm Illahi as
he passed along the narrow street. At his desire it
was now placed in his hand; he examined the blade,
he looked at the ornaments on the hilt. Bál Mukand
also had, half an hour before, noticed and admired
the scimitar, which had been, a short time previously,
purchased by Shib Das from an Afghan chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mohammedan, Karm Illahi, inquired the price
of the scimitar, which he greatly desired to possess.</p>

<p>“The price is thirty rupees,” was the reply of
Shib Das.</p>

<p>“I thought that he would have said sixty or
seventy at least,” thought the astonished Bál Mukand.
“Surely the jewels in the hilt are worth much more
than thirty rupees.”</p>

<p>Karm Illahi did not betray the joy which he really
felt at hearing a much lower price asked than what
he had expected. Again, slowly and carefully, he
tried the blade and examined the hilt.</p>

<p>“Are all these jewels real?” he inquired of the
seller.</p>

<p>“All but this sapphire in the centre,” replied Shib
Das. “The imitation is so good that I myself was
at first deceived. Were that jewel real, I should
have asked double the price for the weapon.”</p>

<p>“I will give you twenty rupees,” said Karm
Illahi—who had never yet bought anything without
trying to lower the price. Had he been offered a
hen for an anna, he would have tried to get it for
eleven pies.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>“No,” replied Shib Das calmly; “I have but one
price for the things in my shop, and that is the fair
one. A year ago I should have asked you at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
seventy rupees for that scimitar, and have sworn
that every jewel in the hilt was real.”</p>

<p>“And why do you not do so now?” inquired
Karm Illahi in no small surprise.</p>

<p>“Because I am a Christian,” was the simple reply
of Shib Das.</p>

<p>Karm Illahi smiled a mocking smile, but he drew
forth a bag of money which he carried with him, and
counted out the thirty rupees. Bál Mukand heard
him muttering to himself as he did so: “This Christian
is a fool, for none but a fool would have said that
the stone was false, or have asked less for his goods
than he might have hoped to get from a stranger.”</p>

<p>Not such was the thought of the more enlightened
Bál Mukand. “If all men dealt with such
honesty and truth, this would be a happy land,” he
said in his heart. “The folly of such men as this
Shib Das is better than the wisdom of the worldly.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Mussulman left the place with
the scimitar which he had bought, than Yuhanna,
a Christian catechist, came up to the jeweller’s shop.
Still Bál Mukand lay perfectly quiet and listened,
whilst Yuhanna exchanged greetings with Shib Das.</p>

<p>Then said the jeweller: “Doubtless you have
come, O Yuhanna, for the monthly subscription for
the church fund and the support of the poor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, O brother,” replied Yuhanna. “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
going my rounds amongst the Christians, but as yet
I have collected but little. The funds are low, and
we have more sick to help and more widows to
relieve than usual.”</p>

<p>Bál Mukand, where he lay, opened his eyes a
little, and he could see with what a look of pleasure
his friend Shib Das drew four rupees from his store,
and gave them into the hand of Yuhanna.</p>

<p>“It is strange, O Shib Das,” observed the catechist,
“that you give more to the church fund than
do even baboos in government employ. You are not,
I believe, a rich man. How is it that when we ask
for offerings to God we never find your bag empty?”</p>

<p>“The reason is very simple,” was Shib Das’s
cheerful reply. “I am a Christian, and I try to
obey what is written in the Word of my God
regarding offerings made unto Him: <i>Upon the first
day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
store, as God hath prospered him</i> (1 Cor. xvi. 2).
At least a tenth of the profits of my trade I look
upon as the Lord’s, and not my own. Thus I ever
have money at hand to give; and when I give it,
I never miss it.”</p>

<p>“God will accept your gift, and will bless you,”
said the catechist earnestly, ere he turned and went
on his way.</p>

<p>And what was the thought of Bál Mukand as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
lay, apparently asleep, in the innermost and darkest
part of the shop? “If all men showed such piety
and charity, this would be a happy land,” he said
in his heart. “The poverty of such men as Shib
Das is better than the wealth of the worldly.”</p>

<p>The next person who came to the shop was the
bearer of a government official of rank. He carried
with him a necklace which had been broken in
many places. Some of the precious stones had
dropped from their setting. The bearer, whose
name was Parduman, showed the broken ornament
to Shib Das.</p>

<p>“Can you mend this for the Mem Sahiba?”
asked he.</p>

<p>Shib Das was skilful in his craft, and he said
that he could certainly mend the necklace. His
heart was glad, for this was the first time that the
poor Christian goldsmith had been offered employment
by any of the Sahib log, and it seemed to
him as if God were sending prosperity to his house.</p>

<p>“The Mem Sahiba must have her necklace back
on Monday,” said the bearer, “for she is going to a
grand ball on that night.”</p>

<p>“I cannot finish the work so soon,” said Shib
Das, after carefully examining the broken ornament.
A short time before, he would have readily made a
promise, whether he had hoped to be able to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
it or not; but now that Shib Das served the God
of truth, he would have suffered any loss rather
than have broken his word.</p>

<p>“You have all to-morrow to work in,” observed
Parduman, the bearer.</p>

<p>“To-morrow is Sunday, the day set apart for
worship and praise,” said Shib Das. “I have given
up working on that day since I have become a
Christian.”</p>

<p>Then Parduman waxed angry, and roughly took
back the necklace.</p>

<p>“The Sahib and Sahiba are Christians,” he cried,
“and they do their work or take their pleasure on
Sundays. Dost thou, O owl, and son of an owl, set
thyself up as one wiser, or holier than they?”</p>

<p>“Whatever others do, I have simply to obey
what is written in my sacred Book,” said the Christian:
“<i>Remember the Sabbath, to keep it holy</i>.”</p>

<p>Then Parduman, who hated all Christians, and
most especially such as were real ones, burst into a
torrent of abuse. Every bitter and insulting epithet
that he could think of flowed from his lips, as
venom from the mouth of a snake. Bál Mukand,
from his dark corner, watched to see how his friend
would endure the provocation which he was receiving.
“Shib Das is of a fiery temper,” he said to
himself; “he is also strong and bold. He will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
give that foul-mouthed wretch sharp words back, or
something sharper than words.” Bál Mukand saw
that the angry blood was rising to the cheek of
Shib Das, and expected a burst of passion to follow.
But the servant of Christ pressed his own lips
firmly together, and returned not railing for railing.
He only said, as his enemy, still pouring forth
abuse, turned to depart, “It is a fortunate thing for
you, O bearer, that I am a Christian.”</p>

<p>“There is a strange change in this Shib Das,”
thought Bál Mukand. “I have known him in
former days strike a man to the earth for far less
provocation than this. It is assuredly not cowardice
that makes him now thus calmly endure. If all men
had the firmness and patience of this Shib Das, this
would indeed be a happy land. The silent endurance
of such men as this Christian, shows more true
courage than the boldest deeds of the warrior.”</p>

<p>Bál Mukand had but a short time to give to
such reflections, for scarcely had the bearer left the
jeweller’s shop when the sound of a fearful scuffle
was heard in the street. Three thieves of the city
had gained information that Parduman had in his
charge a necklace of inestimable value. Lurking
near the goldsmith’s shop, these thieves had heard
the abuse lavished by the bearer on the Christian.
While revilings and curses were yet on the lips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Parduman, he was suddenly felled to the earth by
a blow. Being active and strong, he struggled
again to his feet, calling out loudly for help. But
the three thieves were far more than a match for
the bearer. A second time he was hurled bleeding
to the ground, and his wicked tongue might then
have been silenced for ever, had not the brave Shib
Das rushed out of his shop to the help of his enemy.
The jeweller had snatched up a heavy stick on
hearing Parduman’s cry for help; and of this stick
he made such vigorous use that the thieves were
not only put to flight, but forced to leave the jewels
behind them.</p>

<p>The care of Shib Das was then given to his
wounded enemy. He offered to bind Parduman’s
hurts as kindly as if he had been his brother;
but the Hindu declined his aid. Shib Das then
brought him water to drink; but the bearer refused
to take it from his hands: he would have thought
himself polluted by touching with his lips the vessel
of the Christian.</p>

<p>Bál Mukand had watched the whole scene with
keen interest. “If all men were generous and
forgiving as this Christian,”—this was the thought
of Bál Mukand,—“this would indeed be a happy
land. Does yon bigoted Hindu fear pollution from
the touch of Shib Das? Were the bearer not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
blinded by superstition, he would know that there
is no caste so high and pure as that of the children
of God.”</p>

<p>Parduman left the necklace for the goldsmith to
repair,—perhaps from some feeling of gratitude towards
his preserver, perhaps because he feared,
should he keep the jewels on his own person, to be
again attacked on the road. With a bruised frame
and bleeding brow Parduman left the place, and, we
may hope, likewise with a humbled heart, resolved
that he would not again abuse a man for being a
Christian, or despise him for obeying the law of his
God.</p>

<p>Bál Mukand had risen from his reclining posture
at the first sound of the struggle in the street,
though he had not, like Shib Das, rushed out to the
aid of the bearer. Bál Mukand now, with a countenance
full of thought, advanced towards his friend.</p>

<p>“O Shib Das!” he exclaimed, “said I not an
hour ago that the way to the Christian’s heaven
was dark, and that with all my searching and reading
I was not able to find it? Lo! since I entered
your shop a clear light has shone on the way.”</p>

<p>“What is your meaning, my friend?” asked the
goldsmith.</p>

<p>“I have discovered the difference between the
false flowers and the real; between those that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
lifeless and those that have drunk the rain from the
sky. I have seen that what is written in your
Bible is true, though the words were at first an
unfathomable mystery to my soul: <i>If any man be
in Christ, he is a new creature</i> (2 Cor. v. 17). I
have beheld the well-watered garden in which grow
the fruits of honesty and truth, piety and obedience,
meekness, forgiveness, and love.”</p>

<p>“O my friend!” exclaimed Shib Das, “I am in
myself weak, sinful, polluted; it is only through
the death of Christ my Lord that I am saved from
eternal destruction. It is only through the power
of His Holy Spirit that I am enabled so much as to
think one good thought.”</p>

<p>“Having been saved, the Christian loves; and
having loved, he obeys; and in obeying he glorifies
God,” said Bál Mukand. “Shib Das, your <i>example</i>
has done for me what all your words cannot do: it
has convinced me that the religion which produces
such effects must be the true one; it has made me
resolve to become a Christian also.”</p>

<p>The life of every true servant of the Holy Saviour
is as a lamp to light others on their way, as the
blessed Lord showed when He said: <i>Let your light
so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven</i>
(Matt. v. 16).</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Three men sat conversing together in the
evening, when the glowing sun had just
dipped below the horizon. The names
of these men were Lalla Rám, Hukam Chand, and
Lajput Rai. Lalla Rám was the inhabitant of a
village, and dwelt in a mud-built hut. Hukam
Chand kept a little shop in a crowded lane of the
city of Lahore. Lajput Rai had no settled place of
abode; he was a sage who had travelled much, had
seen much, had thought much, and his words were
deemed words of wisdom.</p>

<p>The first one of the three who spoke was the
villager, Lalla Rám. He had been revolving in his
mind news that he had heard that day—namely, that
the orphan daughter of a friend of his had been
placed in a school. This was a cause of great displeasure
to Lalla Rám.</p>

<p>“It is an evil thing,” said he, “that schools for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
girls are now being planted over our land. Who
would be so foolish as to sow corn upon a pool?
Who would teach letters to a cow? Hath the sheep
power to acquire knowledge? Woman was made to
toil and bear burdens; she was made to labour in the
field, and to grind at the mill. A book placed in the
hand of a girl is as an ear-ring in the ear of an ass!”</p>

<p>Then spake he who dwelt in Lahore—he whose
wife was ever in pardah:—“I too would close all
schools for girls; but not because, in my opinion, it
is good for women to labour. No: let our wives and
daughters keep in pardah; and if they want amusement,
let them find it in decking themselves out
with jewels.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Women are quick enough in learning
mischief without sharpening their wits by books.
To put knowledge within the grasp of woman, is to
put an edge-tool into the hand of a fool! Woman
is only happy in ignorance, and only safe in
seclusion.”</p>

<p>“My friends,” said the sage Lajput Rai, “did
you ever hear the story of the rajah and the three
sheets of paper?”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Lalla Rám and Hukam Chand.
“My lord, we pray you, tell us the story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“A great rajah,” began Lajput Rai, “called to
him three of his servants, and committed to each
of them a fair sheet of paper, upon which no letter
had ever been traced. The rajah told none of the
three wherefore he had given the paper, but only
said, ‘Use it with wisdom.’ But he said to himself,
‘I will judge of the understanding of each of
these my servants by the use to which he shall put
my gift; and he who showeth most wisdom shall
receive a high place in my household.’</p>

<p>“After a long time had passed, the rajah again
called his three servants; and after they had made
their saláms, thus he spake to the first: ‘To what
use hast thou put that fair sheet of blank paper
which I committed to thy charge, for I wish to look
on it now?’</p>

<p>“‘I wrapped seed in it, O your highness!’ replied
the first servant, ‘and carried it into the field. The
paper fell on the earth, damp with the rains, and was
marred; my ox placed his foot upon it; it was
trampled down into the clay. It is therefore impossible
that I should lay it at your majesty’s foot-stool.’</p>

<p>“Then said the rajah to his second servant, ‘To
what use hast thou put that goodly sheet of blank
paper which I committed to thy charge, for I wish
to behold it again?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I put the paper to no use whatsoever, O maharajah!’
replied the man, with a profound salám.
‘I rolled it up, and put it carefully on a shelf in an
inner apartment, where no man could see it. But
the damp spotted and stained it, and the white ants
fretted it; the paper is no longer fit to be looked
upon by the eyes of your highness.’</p>

<p>“Then the rajah turned to his third servant, and
said, ‘To what use hast thou put that fair sheet of
blank paper which I committed to thy charge?’</p>

<p>“Then the servant, after making obeisance, took
from his bosom a roll, which he then slowly unfolded
before the rajah. And lo! upon the roll, in letters
of scarlet, and blue, and gold, appeared a beautiful
illumination, fit for the walls of a palace. And these
were the words inscribed:—<i>Who can find a virtuous
woman? for her price is far above rubies. The
heart of her husband doth safely trust in her. She
will do him good and not evil all the days of her
life</i> (Prov. xxxi. 10-12).</p>

<p>“‘O faithful and wise servant!’ cried the rajah,
‘thou alone hast made a good use of my gift, thou
only hast known its worth. Thou shalt reap a rich
reward; and the paper which thy diligence hath
made so fair, shall be framed in gold, and have an
honourable place in my palace.’</p>

<p>“My friends,” continued the sage, “see ye the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
meaning of my story? The blank sheets of paper
are the minds of our young daughters; and he who
hath trusted them to your care is the mighty King,
to whom ye must one day render a strict account.
Ignorance is as the treading down of the ox in the
field, or as the mould that mars the roll on the shelf.
<i>For the soul to be without knowledge is not good.</i>
But happy the father who causes to be traced on the
mind of his young daughter lessons of purity, wisdom,
and truth! Those lessons shall shine forth as in
characters of gold; and she who has learned in youth
to serve and obey the great King, shall find an
honourable place in that heaven which He hath
prepared for them that love Him.”</p>

<span class="smaller">The Oldest Language upon Earth.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The story goes that three old men—a
Mohammedan, a Jew, and a Brahmin—seated
on the ground beside a well, disputed
together as to which was the first language
spoken upon earth. The discussion waxed so hot,
the voices were raised so loudly, that the sound drew
to the spot a young Englishman. The youth had
been out shooting; with his gun in his hand, and
his game at his feet, he now stood, leaning against
a tree, listening to the discussion between the three
men.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan, with vehement gestures, and
many an oath, declared that no language could equal
the Arabic.</p>

<p>“Is it not the language,” he cried, “in which
Mohammed (blessed be his name!) received the holy
Koran? Is it not that in which the Most High gave
laws to the faithful? Will ye, O ye unbelievers!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
cast dust on the grave of the Prophet by doubting
that Arabic is the oldest language on earth?”</p>

<p>The Jew shook his gray head, and his brow was
knit into many wrinkles as he made answer: “The
language which Abraham our father, which Isaac
and Jacob (peace be on them!) spake, must be
honoured above all other tongues. Surely it was
heard in Paradise, before Eve plucked the forbidden
fruit! The oldest and most sacred language assuredly
is the Hebrew.”</p>

<p>Then spake the Brahmin, in tones of scorn: “All
languages compared to Sanscrit are as the bulrush
compared with the spreading banyan. Nay; even
as the banyan sends forth shoots, and from those
shoots, when they touch the earth, spring forth
young trees, so other tongues spring from the life-giving
Sanscrit. He must be void of wisdom, and
ignorant as a woman, who doubts that the most
ancient language is Sanscrit.”</p>

<p>The disputants grew so angry, that it seemed as
if to words might succeed blows, when the young
Englishman stepped forward.</p>

<p>“O venerable men!” he said with courtesy, “you
have numbered many years and I but few; yet let
me arbitrate between you. I know what is the
most ancient and honourable language spoken on
earth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know!” exclaimed the Mohammedan in
surprise. “You have but down upon your lips;
and will you teach graybeards like us?”</p>

<p>The Hindu muttered to himself,—“The Sahib
log think that they know everything! They can
make roads and bridges, and send messages through
wires; but what can they tell of ancient languages
to a Brahmin?”</p>

<p>“The language of which I would inform you is
not only the one first spoken upon earth, but it is
the one now spoken in heaven,” said the Englishman.</p>

<p>The three men stroked their beards, and uttered
exclamations of astonishment at the presumption
shown by the youth.</p>

<p>“And yet more,” continued the youth, his eyes,
blue as the sky, sparkling with animation as he
went on,—“without learning to speak this language
no man, of whatsoever nation he be, will ever be
suffered to enter heaven.”</p>

<p>“Does your honour know this language?” asked
the Mohammedan quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, God be praised!” the Englishman replied.</p>

<p>“And where did you first learn it?” asked the
incredulous Jew.</p>

<p>In a softened tone the young man replied, “I
learned it first from the lips of my mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The three men glanced at each other in surprise;
and then the Brahmin inquired, “And what is this
language, O Sahib?”</p>

<p>“The language of <span class="smcapuc">TRUTH</span>,” said the Englishman.</p>

<p>When the word was spoken, the clouds cleared
away from the faces of the three; they stroked their
beards and cried, “Well said. Truth is the language
of God; truth is the language spoken in heaven.”</p>

<p>“But it must be learned upon earth,” said the
Englishman earnestly. “Before I came to this land,
I gave up pleasures by day and rest by night, in
order to learn the language of Hindostan. Were I
not to know it, I could not remain in the honourable
service to which I belong. And thus it is with
truth, the language of heaven. God is truth itself,
and a lie is to Him an accursed thing. It is written
in His Word: <i>Lying lips are an abomination to the
Lord.</i>”</p>

<p>Again the three men glanced at each other.
There was not one of them that would not have lied
for the sake of making a few pice larger profit in a
bargain; lies were to them common as the mosquitoes
which buzzed around their heads; not one of them
had ever thought of falsehood as a deadly sin, abhorrent
to God.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan was the one to speak first.</p>

<p>“Upon what authority does the Sahib affirm that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the gate of heaven is closed against those who speak
not the language of truth?”</p>

<p>“On the authority of God’s holy Word, which
cannot be broken,” replied the Englishman. “Hear,
O my friends, what is declared of the abode of the
blessed by Him who cannot utter untruth: <i>There shall
in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither
whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie.</i>”</p>

<p>“Heaven will be very empty, then,” said the Jew
with a sneer. “Your favoured Saint Peter, according
to your own Scriptures, lied thrice, and with
oaths and curses. Shall he be shut out from heaven,
or shall his sin alone go unpunished?”</p>

<p>“Peter’s sin <i>was</i> punished,” replied the Englishman
gravely; “but it was Peter’s Lord, the Master
whom Peter had denied, who bore the penalty for
him. The blood that flowed from the Saviour’s
wounded side can wash away all sin, whether of
thought or word or deed, the sin of falsehood
amongst the rest. But those who would be forgiven
like Peter, must, like Peter, believe and love. When
God’s Spirit comes into the heart, He comes to drive
away evil from it; the unjust becomes just, and the
proud becomes meek, and the lips that often were
stained with falsehood learn the language of heaven—the
language of truth.”</p>

<span class="smaller">Stories on the Ten Commandments.</span></h2>

<h3 id="XI_1">I.—THE BROKEN BRIDGE.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hossein said to his aged grandfather
Abbas, “O grandfather, wherefore are
you reading the Gospel?”</p>

<p>Abbas made answer, “I read it, my son, to find
the way to heaven.”</p>

<p>Hossein, smiling, said, “The way is plain enough.
Worship but the one true God, and keep the Commandments.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The man whose hair was silvered with age made
reply: “Hossein, the Commandments are as a bridge
of ten arches, by which the soul might once have
passed over the flood of God’s wrath, and have
reached heaven, but that the bridge has been shattered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
There is not one amongst us that hath not
broken the Commandments again and again.”</p>

<p>“My conscience is clear!” cried Hossein proudly.
“I have kept all the Commandments; at least,
almost all,” he added, for his conscience had given
the lie to his words.</p>

<p>“And if one arch of a bridge give way under the
traveller, doth he not surely perish in the flood, my
son, though the nine others be firm and strong?
But many of the arches of thy bridge are broken;
yea, the very first is in ruins.”</p>

<p>“Not the First Commandment—<i>Thou shalt have
none other god but Me.</i> I have never broken that!”
exclaimed Hossein indignantly. “I have never
worshipped any god but one—the Almighty, the
Invisible, the All-merciful. <i>That</i> arch in my bridge,
at least, is whole and entire.”</p>

<p>“The being whom we love above all others, and
whose honour we most desire, the being whom we obey
in all things,—is not he the one whom we worship
in the temple of the heart?” inquired the old man.</p>

<p>“Surely; for that Being is our God!” exclaimed
Hossein.</p>

<p>He of the silvery beard slowly rose from his seat.
“Come with me, O youth,” said he, “and I will
show thee whom thou dost worship in the temple of
thine heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“No man can show me Him whom I worship!”
cried Hossein in indignant surprise; “for the one true
God is invisible, and I worship none but Him.”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” repeated Abbas; and he led
the way to a tank of water clear and pure, in which
the surrounding buildings and trees were reflected
as in a mirror.</p>

<p>Hossein followed his grandfather wondering, and
saying to himself, “Age hath made the old man as
one who hath lost his reason.”</p>

<p>When the two reached the tank, Abbas said to
his grandson, “Look down into the clear water, and
behold him whom thou dost love above all others,
whose honour thou dost most desire, whose will
thou dost ever obey. O Hossein, my son! is he not
to thee in the place of the one true God?”</p>

<p>Hossein looked down, and behold! there was his
own image reflected in the clear water.</p>

<p>“He who loves Self more than God hath broken
the first law,” continued Abbas; “for is it not written:
<i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,
and with all thy strength: this is the First Commandment?</i>
Hossein, this arch of thy bridge is
broken; thou canst not pass to heaven upon it.”</p>

<p>“And can you?” exclaimed Hossein with impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, my son,” said the old man meekly; “I
have long ago seen that this, as well as other Commandments,
has been broken by me, a sinner.
There never was but one Man, and He the Holy
One of God, with whom the bridge of obedience was
perfect and entire.”<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>“If your bridge be broken, how do you hope to
reach heaven at all?” inquired Hossein. “How
can you, or any one else, escape being swallowed
up in the flood of God’s wrath?”</p>

<p>“By clinging to Him who cast Himself into the
raging torrent that He might bear all those who
believe in Him safe to the shore of heaven!” exclaimed
Abbas with fervour. “Thou hast looked
down on thyself, thy sinful self, O Hossein; now
look upwards to Christ, the spotless One, who can
save thee from self and sin. My hope of heaven is
firm and sure, for it is founded on this sacred word:
<i>God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoso believeth in Him should not
perish, but have everlasting life.</i>”</p>

<h3 id="XI_2">II.—THE BURNING HUT.</h3>

<p>Sheosahai, the Brahmin, stood in his straw-thatched
cottage, gazing on the image of Krishna, the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
god, which for centuries he and his fathers had
worshipped.</p>

<p>His young son, Sheo Deo, who from his birth had
been paralyzed in his limbs, lay on his mat near, and
thus addressed his father:—</p>

<p>“O father, the time for pujah (worship) has
come! Why do you not prostrate yourself before
Krishna?”</p>

<p>Sheosahai made reply: “My son, I was at the
<i>mela</i> (fair) yesterday, and there was a man preaching;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
and I stood to listen, and his words have
troubled my soul. He said that thousands of years
ago the mighty God came down upon a mountain in
fire and smoke, and that from the midst of the fire
and smoke a terrible voice gave this command,—<i>Thou
shalt not make unto thyself any graven image,
or the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,
or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to
them.</i> I would fain have cast dust at the speaker;
and yet his words clung to my soul, for he spake as
one who knows that he speaks the truth.”</p>

<p>“Was the great God of whom he told the God of
the Christians?” asked Sheo Deo, who had heard
something of their religion before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“The same,” replied his father. “And the
preacher went on to say that in England, thousands
of years ago, men bowed down to idols, and worshipped
the work of their own hands; and then the
people were feeble and few. But the nation has
long since cast away idols, and now men read their
holy Book, and pray to the Lord Jesus Christ; and
therefore England is mighty, and a blessing rests on
the land.”</p>

<p>“O father! do you not fear the wrath of Krishna
when he hears you repeat such words?” cried Sheo
Deo, looking up in alarm at the painted image.</p>

<p>Sheosahai made no reply; he turned and slowly
left the hut. Perhaps the thought arose in his
heart: “Has Krishna power to hear them?”</p>

<p>After his father’s departure Sheo Deo lay still on
his mat, from which he could not move, and often he
gazed up at the idol, and turned over in his mind
the strange words which his father had heard.</p>

<p>Presently there came on a terrible storm. The
thunder roared above like the noise of a thousand
cannon, and fierce lightnings flashed from the darkened
sky; the whole earth seemed to tremble with the
fury of the great tempest.</p>

<p>“Was it in a storm like this,” thought Sheo Deo,
“that the awful voice was heard from the mountain,
<i>Thou shalt make no graven image</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a more terrible crash than Sheo Deo
had ever before heard; and the moment after there
was the smell of burning, and then the glare of fire
above. Lo! the lightning had struck the hut, and
the thatch was blazing over the head of the wretched
boy, who, paralyzed as he was, could not even crawl
out of the burning dwelling.</p>

<p>The red light glared on the image of Krishna; to
the terrified Sheo Deo it seemed almost as if the
idol had life!</p>

<p>“Help me—save me! Oh! save thy worshipper,
great Krishna!” he cried; while the heat around him
grew more and more fearful, even as that of a
furnace.</p>

<p>But the image stirred not, heard not. The sparks
were kindling upon it.</p>

<p>Then, in the agony of his terror, the poor Hindu
bethought him of the Christian’s powerful God.
Even in the presence of his idol he clasped his hands
and uttered the cry, “O Lord Jesus Christ, if Thou
canst save me, oh! save me!”</p>

<p>At that moment Sheosahai burst into the blazing
hut.</p>

<p>The Brahmin looked at his helpless boy lying on
the mat, and then on the idol which he had so long
worshipped. He had no time to save <i>both</i>; which
should he leave to the devouring flames? Only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
day previously the Hindu might have hesitated in
making his choice, but he did not hesitate now.
He caught up his son in his arms; he bore him
forth from the fiery furnace. “If Krishna be a god
he will save himself,” muttered the Brahmin.</p>

<p>The hut was soon burned to ashes, and the idol
lay a heap of cinders within it.</p>

<p>Sheo Deo lived; and in the following year, after
much instruction from the missionary, he and his
father received the water of baptism, believing that
which is written in the holy Scriptures: <i>This is life
eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.</i></p>

<h3 id="XI_3">III.—THE MARKS ON THE SAND.</h3>

<p>A Mohammedan youth, Hakim Alí by name, on his
return from a journey through Arabia, visited his
friend Yuhanna, the Christian. Though the two
held not the same faith, there was much friendship
between them.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> They sat together under a pépul
tree, and Hakim Alí, with great animation, gave to
Yuhanna an account of all that he had seen in his
travels. For a long time Yuhanna had all the
listening, and his friend had all the talking. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
almost every sentence uttered by Hakim Alí, he
brought in the name of Allah (God); if he were
but describing how a mule stumbled, or what evil
fare he had had at an inn, he called God to bear
witness to what he said—even if he were laughing
when the holy name was on his lips. Yuhanna had
a stick in his hand, and every time that Hakim Alí
uttered the sacred name, Yuhanna with the stick
made a mark on the sand. Hakim Alí at last
noticed with surprise this act of Yuhanna.</p>

<p>“What are you marking?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Debts,” was the brief reply.</p>

<p>“You have many,” laughed Hakim Alí, again
using the name of the Highest; and again Yuhanna
drew a line on the sand.</p>

<p>Then Yuhanna, turning, asked a question: “You
have visited many holy shrines and sacred tombs in
your life, O Hakim Alí!” said he; “did you ever
take off your slippers before entering?”<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Hakim Alí was so much astonished at the question,
that more loudly than ever he uttered the name of
Allah. “Do you count me as an unclean swine?”
he exclaimed; “do you doubt that I always take off
my slippers on such occasions? Never without due
reverence do I approach that which is holy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Yuhanna pointed to the marks on the sand.
“O my friend!” said he, “fifteen times within
the last hour have you shown no reverence for that
which is most holy.”</p>

<p>“What is your meaning?” exclaimed the astonished
Hakim Alí, again lightly using the sacred name of
God.</p>

<p>Once more Yuhanna made a mark on the sand.</p>

<p>“Is a building made by the hands of men more
to be reverenced than that sacred name before which
the angels bow?” said Yuhanna gravely. “Is not
every time that that name is taken in vain marked
down,—not on sand, where it can be lightly effaced,
but in that book of remembrance which is kept by
the Highest? O my friend! it was the voice of
the Almighty Himself that gave the command: <i>Thou
shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,
for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh
His name in vain.</i> This command was written
first by the finger of God on the table of stone
committed to Moses.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>“Are you Christians then so careful how you take
the name of God on your lips?” asked Hakim Alí,
rising somewhat angrily from his seat.</p>

<p>“We, of all men, should be most careful,” replied
his friend, “for in the prayer taught by the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Jesus Christ to His servants, the very first petition
to God is, <i>Hallowed be Thy name</i>. If we use that
name without reverence, our very prayer becomes a
mockery, and we are convicted of sin before God.
Solemn was the warning given by our Lord: <i>Every
idle word that a man shall speak, he shall give
account thereof in the day of judgment.</i>”</p>

<p>“Who then can stand in the day of judgment?”
asked Hakim Alí with a troubled countenance, as
with his foot he hastily erased the marks on the
sand.</p>

<p>“None can stand but those who can plead not
their own righteousness, but the righteousness of
another,” replied Yuhanna, looking upwards. “Like
the prophet Isaiah I have often cried: <i>Woe is me! for
I am undone, for I am a man of unclean lips</i>;
but when I think of the blood that was shed by
Christ on the cross for sinners, to my heart the
answer comes: <i>Lo! this hath touched thy lips, and
thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus.</i>”</p>

<h3 id="XI_4">IV.—THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN.</h3>

<p>There was a certain man who had a young son,
Azfur Alí by name, whom he greatly loved, and
whom he daily loaded with favours. One day this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
father said unto Azfur Alí,—“Come with me into
the garden which I have purchased and prepared
that it may be a goodly possession for you, O my
son!”</p>

<p>The father then led the way to a beautiful garden,
in which were all kinds of flowers,—some
lovely in colour, some sweet in scent. The garden
was divided into seven portions; and the flowers in
the seventh portion were white as snow on the tops
of the mountains.</p>

<p>“Now, my son, take your pleasure in six portions
of this garden,” said the father; “but the
seventh I have kept for myself. Let not your foot
wander over the border; enjoy the scent of the
flowers from a little distance, but lay not a hand
upon them. Behold! they are mine, and in abstaining
from touching them your obedience to me shall
be shown. It is my love for you, Azfur Alí, that
makes me thus reserve the seventh portion. To the
white flowers which blossom there on the plants will
succeed a delicious fruit, to look upon which will be
pleasure, and to eat which will be health. The
seventh portion is to be to you even a greater blessing
than the other six; but now I call it mine, so
trespass not on the ground reserved.”</p>

<p>After a while the father departed for a time to a
distant place, leaving his young son behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>From morning till night Azfur Alí amused himself
in the garden; he gathered the flowers at his
pleasure, and formed wreaths of the fairest blossoms,
red, yellow, and blue; but his eyes often wandered
to the forbidden ground on which his feet were never
to tread.</p>

<p>“Why should I be tied and bound down to these
six portions of the garden?” cried Azfur Alí. “I
do not like the scent of those white flowers; if I
pulled them up, I could put in their place golden
flowers that I like much better. As for the fruit of
which my father spoke, I do not believe that it ever
will come; at least, I cannot wait for it. A hard
and unreasonable thing it is, to shut me out from a
seventh part of my garden.”</p>

<p>So Azfur Alí ran into the forbidden ground,
trampling down the plants, and crushing the fair
white blossoms, and some he tore up by the roots.
Then he tried to put in their place plants that had
golden flowers; but they flourished not, but withered,
and the seventh portion of the garden was soon
covered with weeds, and became a desolation!</p>

<p>When the father returned his wrath was great.
“Azfur Alí!” he cried, “thou hast broken my
command, thou hast trespassed on the seventh portion
of the garden which I reserved for myself, and
hast destroyed the flowers which would have borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
precious fruit. Thou hast forfeited all right from
henceforth to possess any part of my garden.”</p>

<p class="tb">This story is a parable. The garden is the garden
of Time, and the seventh portion is the Sabbath
which the Heavenly Father hath reserved for Himself,
as we read in His holy Word: <i>Remember the
Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant,
thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh
day, and hallowed it.</i></p>

<p>The white blossoms that grow in this garden are
the blossoms of Prayer, and Praise, and Perusal of the
Holy Scriptures. The fragrance of them is as the
fragrance of the Garden of Eden. But the full
sweetness of the fruit which follows will be enjoyed
in heaven, where the hymn of praise on earth will be
changed for the song of the Lord’s redeemed: <i>The
kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of
the Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign for
ever and ever!</i></p>

<h3 id="XI_5">V.—THE BLIND MOTHER.</h3>

<p>Nand Kishore was driven from his home because
he had become a Christian. His dearest friends
would not eat with him, or suffer him to cross
their thresholds; his younger brother seized on his
small property; and, worst of all, his widowed
mother, Harmuzi, beating her breast, cursed her first-born,
who had been to her as the apple of her eye.
Then the soul of Nand Kishore was sorely smitten;
in great grief he turned from the door of what had
been his home from his childhood. But he remembered
the words of the Saviour for whose sake he
had given up all: <i>If any man love father or mother
more than Me, he is not worthy of Me. Blessed are
they that are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i></p>

<p>Harmuzi had in her anger cursed her first-born,
but her heart clung to him still. Great was her
grief when, a year afterwards, she heard a report
of the death of Nand Kishore. And Harmuzi had
other sore trials: blindness gradually came upon
her, till at last all the light of heaven to her was
darkened. And her son Mohendro showed her no
love or respect. He had married a proud woman,
who despised her poor blind mother-in-law, and
made her life bitter with cruel words. Mohendro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
more than once even struck<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> his afflicted mother;
and Harmuzi was treated as a slave in the house
which had once been her own.</p>

<p>“Ah! my poor Nand Kishore would not have
behaved to me thus!” sighed the unhappy mother,
when she remembered him whom she had cursed,
only because he had done what he felt to be right.</p>

<p>Harmuzi’s cruel daughter-in-law grudged her even
the food which she ate. “Thou canst not grind the
corn, or bring water from the well,” she said; “and
yet thou dost devour our substance. Go out into
the street and beg! When passers-by look on your
blind eyes, they may at least put a handful of grain
into your vessel.”</p>

<p>Hungry and sad, and bowed down by sorrow,
poor Harmuzi, wrapped in her chaddar, sat at the
corner of a street, with a brass vessel, called a bartan,
beside her, and held out her thin hand for alms.
She had sat there for hours, whilst many passed by
her, but as yet she had received nothing from any
one,—not so much as a word of pity. At last Harmuzi
heard a slight sound, as if something were
being poured into her bartan; and when she put
forth her hand to feel, lo! the vessel was full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
rice. Then some one gently took the blind woman
by the hand, and raised her, and led her back towards
the house of the undutiful son. Harmuzi
blessed the kind stranger again and again, and asked
Vishnu to load him with blessings. He who led
her spake not a word in reply, but left her at the
corner of a street that was nigh to the house of her
undutiful son.</p>

<p>The next day Harmuzi was again driven forth by
her daughter-in-law to beg, and felt her way slowly
to the same spot where the merciful stranger had
found her. This time she had not to wait so
long. Again was her bartan filled with rice, again
the same gentle hand led the blind woman back;
and she blessed him who had showed her mercy.
But the stranger spake no word in reply.</p>

<p>And this went on for many days. The supply of
rice never failed, and Harmuzi knew not that he
who filled her bartan often himself hungered that
she might be fed. Harmuzi marvelled that she
never heard the sound of the stranger’s voice. “He
hath been smitten with dumbness,” she said to herself.</p>

<p>One day poor Harmuzi, with bruise marks on her
face, sat in her usual place; she was bitterly weeping,
for the hand of her wicked younger son had
been lifted up against his blind and helpless mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
At the sight of Harmuzi’s bruises and tears, he who
had so long restrained himself<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> could keep silence
no longer.</p>

<p>“O mother—mother!” he cried. Harmuzi knew
the voice of her lost Nand Kishore, and suddenly
rising and stretching out her arms, she fell on his
neck weeping.</p>

<p>“O my beloved!” she cried, “is it thou?
How is it that thou hast so long fed and cared for
her who, in an evil hour, cursed her own first-born
son?”</p>

<p>“Dear to my soul!” replied Nand Kishore, “do
you not know that He who said, <i>He that loveth
father or mother more than Me, is not worthy of
Me</i>, also gave this command, <i>Honour thy father
and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee</i>?”</p>

<h3 id="XI_6">VI.—A DANGEROUS VILLAGE.</h3>

<p>Padre Ware, a missionary, revisited a village in
which four heads of families, whose names were
Nihal, Tara Chund, Chanda Lal, and Lala, had
received the gospel, and been baptized. After an
absence of six months Padre Ware returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
village, hoping to find the four Christians firm in
the faith, and glorifying by their holy lives the
Saviour whom they had promised to serve. Alas!
great was the sorrow of Padre Ware to find that
Satan had sown the seeds of discord and hatred
amongst the little band who should have loved one
another, even as Christ had loved them. Nihal had
a quarrel with Tara Chund about a bit of land;
Chanda Lal’s wife had said bitter things against
Lala’s. None of the four would speak with his
neighbour. Even the coming of Padre Ware was a
fresh cause of bitterness. Each one of the four men
asked the missionary to abide in his house; the
Englishman could not go to the one without offending
the other three. Where Padre Ware had hoped
to find love and peace and joy, he found anger,
hatred, and strife.</p>

<p>Under the shade of a banyan-tree sat Padre Ware,
with his Bible in his hand; and thither, to meet him,
came Nihal, Tara Chund, Chanda Lal, and Lala,—but
they sat on the ground as far apart as they could
from each other. Many of the villagers stood at a
little distance to see the missionary, and listen to
his words; but none of these villagers wished to
become Christians, for they said amongst themselves:
“Padre Ware, when he was here before, told us that
God is love, and Christ’s religion a religion of love;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
but behold these men who have been baptized, they
will not so much as eat together!”</p>

<p>Padre Ware looked sadly upon the four converts
who were thus bringing dishonour on the name of
Christians. For a few moments he lifted up his
heart in prayer for them, and then he spoke aloud:—</p>

<p>“It is the desire of my heart that all may be
peace and love between you. Nihal is the oldest
amongst you: let us all go to his house, and take a
meal together, in token that all again are friends.”</p>

<p>But Tara Chund shook his head and cried, “Never
will I cross the threshold of Nihal!” And Chanda
Lal and Lala looked fiercely at each other, and
muttered, “We never will eat together.”</p>

<p>Then said Padre Ware to the four: “I have been
for twelve years a missionary. I have gone in and
out amongst the people; I have never refused to go
to the house of him who invited me, nor to eat with
any who was willing to eat with me. Only once
was I in a great difficulty: I went to one village
where several were ready indeed to receive me, but
I knew that they all were murderers.”</p>

<p>“All murderers!” exclaimed the astonished
Christians. “That was an evil place indeed.”</p>

<p>“What was I to do?” asked Padre Ware.</p>

<p>All the four answered as with one breath,—“Get
out of that village as fast as your honour could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Padre Ware opened his Bible, and slowly
read: <i>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer,
and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life
abiding in him.</i></p>

<p>There was a great silence, and then the missionary
went on:—“O my friends! ye know that God
hath commanded, <i>Thou shalt not kill</i>; and His Word
hath shown us that this command reaches even to
the thoughts of the heart. Ye call yourselves
servants of that Saviour who loved His enemies,
prayed for His enemies, died for His enemies; but
oh! remember that they who come to Him for
pardon and life, must also follow Him in holiness
and love,—for is it not written in the Scriptures of
truth, <i>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he
is none of His</i>”? (Rom. viii. 9).</p>

<p>Again there was a deep silence. Then Nihal arose
from the ground, and going up to Tara Chund, offered
his hookah;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and Tara Chund accepted it with a
smile. The four Christians embraced one another;
and before the evening closed in, those who had
been bitter enemies ate together as friends and
brethren in Christ.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="XI_7">VII.—THE BEAUTIFUL PARDAH.</h3>

<p>It is quite necessary to give a few words of introduction
to the following little story, as without it
the meaning and drift of it would be quite unintelligible
to many British readers. Not all are
aware that it is the custom of Mohammedans of the
upper classes to seclude their women from sight; so
that to allow the face to be seen by any man except
a husband or very near relative is accounted a shame
and disgrace. This custom is called “pardah,” and
it has spread beyond the Mohammedans to some of
the Hindus, &amp;c. A. L. O. E. has seen an old lady
start from her seat as if in great alarm, and hide
herself behind a chair, because an aged gentleman
had chanced to come in sight. Sometimes sufferers
are shut out from receiving medical aid on account
of pardah. At this moment pardah is one of the
greatest obstacles to baptism being received by
one whom we believe to be quite convinced of the
truth of Christianity, and whose husband is a noble-hearted
Christian. Sometimes pardah is actually
kept up by native <i>converts</i>; and this is a grievous
hindrance to them, and besets their path with needless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
difficulties. There is in our mission church a
little pardah room, indeed, in which women can, if
they wish it, hear unseen; but how can a woman
in pardah ever share the Holy Communion—how
can she be actively useful amongst the heathen
around her! Pardah is the napkin under which
a few native converts would hide their talent, and
one cannot but regard it rather as a kind of <i>fashion</i>,
a piece of Oriental worldliness, than a token of
superior delicacy of mind. A woman actually in the
act of hiding her face will sometimes shock our
feelings of refinement in some other way.</p>

<p>Another little explanation is necessary. The
word “pardah”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> has two meanings: one the state
of seclusion which has been described; the other, the
<i>curtain</i> which is the emblem of seclusion. Any
curtain in an English lady’s dwelling is a pardah,
though she is never “in pardah” herself.</p>

<p class="tb">Waziren, a merchant’s wife, came to visit Maryam,
the wife of a moonshee. Both of the women had
been baptized as Christians, but the heart of Waziren
still clung to many of the customs of her people; she
retained prejudices in which she had been brought
up from her childhood. Waziren never came to
church, lest she should break pardah; and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
have thought it unseemly to meet at a meal even
the dearest friend of her husband. Waziren cared
not to learn to read; her only pleasure was in her
jewels, and in gossip, in which her favourite topic
always was the faults of her neighbours. It was for
the sake of talking over news that Waziren now
took her seat on the <i>charpai</i> (low bed) of Maryam.</p>

<p>“Are the tidings true,” asked Waziren, “that
your next-door neighbour, Shadi Shah, arrived last
night from England, a week before he was expected?”</p>

<p>“It is quite true,” Maryam replied. “It was a
great joy to Fatima to see her husband again after
a six months’ absence.”</p>

<p>“A great joy, was it?” said Waziren sneeringly;
and she smiled an unpleasant smile. “I should have
thought that Fatima would have cared little if the
absence of her husband had been one of six years,
instead of six months.”</p>

<p>Maryam looked almost angry, for she saw that
evil thoughts were in the mind of her neighbour.
“Fatima is a good and faithful wife,” she replied.
“Had Shadi Shah remained away for six years, he
would, on his return, have found her just the same
as if he had never left her. Do you not know, O
Waziren! that Fatima has kept in strict pardah all
the time of her husband’s absence?”</p>

<p>“In pardah!” exclaimed the astonished Waziren.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
“Now, for once, O Maryam! I have found you
uttering words of untruth! I happen to know that
Fatima has been to church every week since her
husband’s departure. I am sure that she on foot
has visited friends; nay, I have even heard that
she has taught in a school!” Waziren looked duly
indignant and shocked at such a breach of Oriental
customs, though quite aware that Maryam did all
the things which she professed to think so strange.</p>

<p>“Fatima has done all this,” replied Maryam,
smiling; “and yet she has kept strict pardah.”</p>

<p>“You amaze me!” cried the merchant’s wife.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have never heard that in Fatima’s
house there is a very fine pardah, beautiful and
perfect, though of great antiquity,” said Maryam.
“This pardah is more valuable than any shawl or
Cashmere, or piece of golden embroidery, crusted all
over with jewels!”</p>

<p>“I think that you must have lost your wits!”
exclaimed Waziren, more and more astonished. “I
know no woman with fewer jewels than Fatima. I
am sure that she cannot love her stingy husband.
If she has such a splendid pardah, she never had it
from him. Pray, have you ever seen this wonderful
pardah?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I have one just like it,” replied
Maryam, laying her hand on a book beside her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
which Waziren, though she could not read it, knew
to be the Bible.</p>

<p>“You talk in riddles!” cried the merchant’s wife.</p>

<p>Maryam opened the Holy Book. First, she found
out in the Old Testament the seventh commandment;
and then she turned over to the New Testament and
read aloud: <i>I will therefore that women adorn themselves
in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and
sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls,
or costly array; but (which becometh women professing
godliness) with good works</i> (1 Tim. ii. 9, 10).
Then from another place the Christian woman read:
<i>Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own
husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they may
be won by the conversation of the wives; while they
behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear</i>
(1 Peter iii. 1). And then again Maryam found that
place where that word is written alike for men and
women: <i>Follow peace with all men, and holiness,
without which no man shall see the Lord</i> (Heb. xii.
14). “Behold,” cried Maryam, closing the Bible,
“here is the pardah treasured in the house and heart
of Fatima; and as long as she keeps within it, the
Christian wife requires no other!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="XI_8">VIII.—THE BEARER’S DREAM.</h3>

<p>Ganesh Das, the Commissioner Sahib’s Sardar
bearer, sat with the Bible on his knee; for Ganesh
Das could read, and he had been well instructed
in the Christian religion. He was convinced that
that religion is true, but he loved it not, because
it also is pure and holy. Ganesh Das had read
the commandment, <i>Thou shalt not steal</i> (Ex. xx.
15); his finger was now on the words: <i>Exhort
servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to
please them well in all things; not answering again;
not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that
they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in
all things</i> (Titus ii. 9, 10). Ganesh Das with vexation
closed the Bible and pushed it aside.</p>

<p>“What!” he cried; “must I, if I be baptized,
give up all cheating, get nothing but my pay, never
take from my rich master one pie that is not lawfully
mine! No, no; this is more than I can do! Let
others be Christians,—Ganesh Das cannot break off
from the habit of years, and make himself poor for
the sake of the gospel!”</p>

<p>That night Ganesh Das had a dream. He
dreamed that he and many others stood in a slave-market,
heavily chained, and the voice of wailing
was heard around. One who wore a black robe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
stood near, and to him Ganesh Das addressed this
question,—</p>

<p>“Why are we chained here? What hath brought
us into this place of shame and sorrow?”</p>

<p>“O lost one!” replied the stranger, “thou and
all around thee have been sold to a fearful tyrant,
who, after ye have done his work, will cast you into
devouring flames, for thus he always treats his slaves
when their time of labour for him is ended.”</p>

<p>“How came we to be slaves? What villain hath
sold us?” exclaimed the indignant Sardar.</p>

<p>“O man!” the stranger replied, “no one is here
that hath not sold himself into bondage; and lo! the
money which he hath received in exchange for his
soul is now the chain with which he is bound.
Fools, fools! hath not Christ said: <i>What shall it
profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose
his own soul? Or what shall a man give in
exchange for his soul?</i>” (Mark viii. 36.)</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there was a fearful noise of
drums, mingled with shrieks and howlings: the
tyrant was coming to the slave-market to claim his
victims.</p>

<p>Ganesh Das in his dream trembled exceedingly,
for never had he beheld a form so horrible as that
which he looked on now. The glare of the enemy’s
eyes was as the glare of the tiger’s when he rangeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the jungle at night for his prey. The tyrant
advanced to the first of the slaves, and Ganesh Das
saw a poor wretch crouching down in extreme terror
at the feet of the soul-destroyer.</p>

<p>Then he of the black robe said: “Behold! this
wretch is a mighty vizier, who became wealthy as a
rajah through the bribes which he took. Look at
the gold and the jewels which bind him now, so
that he cannot so much as look up!”</p>

<p>Ganesh Das looked, and behold the golden chains
were eating into the very flesh of the man who had
sold himself to the soul-destroyer.</p>

<p>“He is mine!” cried the tyrant; “bear him
away!”</p>

<p>Then he advanced to the slave who was next to
Ganesh Das,—a man who stood with his eyes almost
starting from his head with terror, whilst he vainly
tried to burst fetters made of silver rupees.</p>

<p>“This is a dacoit,”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> said he of the black robe;
“he hath sold himself for the silver chain which
thou seest.”</p>

<p>“He is mine!” cried the tyrant; “bear him
away!”</p>

<p>“I shall be next,” thought the terrified dreamer.
He looked down on his own galling chains, and lo!
they were formed of innumerable pice and pies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
fruit of petty frauds for which he had sold his soul.
The destroyer approached; the trembling Sardar
seemed already to hear the doom, “He is mine!
bear him away!” The poor wretch made so desperate
an effort to burst his chains, that lo! he
awoke from his dream.</p>

<p>Ganesh Das still trembled, but he was thankful
that his day of grace was not yet past, that it was
not yet too late to escape the soul-destroyer. He
fell on his knees, repeating words which he had
learned from the Bible: <i>Let the wicked forsake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and
let him return unto the Lord, and He will have
mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will
abundantly pardon</i> (Isa. lv. 7). <i>For the wages
of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord</i> (Rom. vi. 23).</p>

<h3 id="XI_9">IX.—THE CRACKED SCENT-BOTTLE.</h3>

<p>Mohendro, the Padre Sahib’s bearer, saw that Melo,
the Mem Sahiba’s new ayah,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> had a troubled countenance.</p>

<p>“Why are you troubled, Melo?” asked he.</p>

<p>“When dusting the Mem Sahiba’s room,” replied
Melo, “I threw down her beautiful scent-bottle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
The scent-bottle was cracked, and the sweet water
was all spilt.”</p>

<p>“What matters it to you?” said the bearer, smiling.
“You have been but one day in the house; put
the bottle back in its place, and when the Mem
Sahiba sees that it has been emptied and cracked,
say that you found it so, and that the last ayah
certainly did the mischief.”</p>

<p>A short time before, Melo would have thought
nothing of telling a lie; but she was now a baptized
Christian, and had been taught God’s Commandments.
Melo knew that one of them is, <i>Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbour</i> (Ex. xx. 16).
Melo had resolved to keep a strict watch over her
lips, for she had learned the text: <i>Lying lips are
abomination to the Lord</i> (Prov. xii. 22). “I am
afraid to tell my Mem Sahiba a lie,” she replied.</p>

<p>The bearer laughed at her words. “Why, to lie
comes as natural as to eat!” he cried. “The last
ayah has gone away to Benares, so your lie will do
no harm to any one in the world.”</p>

<p>Melo thought to herself, “Will it do no harm to
myself?” But Melo was but a new Christian;
habit is strong, and she had been accustomed to tell
lies from the time that she first could speak. Melo
resolved that when her Mem Sahiba noticed the
harm done to the scent-bottle, she would say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the last ayah had done it. She was timid, and
could not bear that the Mem Sahiba, whose service
she had just entered, should think her careless.</p>

<p>The Padre Sahib had morning prayers in Urdu,
and such of his servants as were Christians were
always allowed to attend. It was the first time
that Melo had ever been present at family worship.
She sat on the carpet, watching the Sahib as he
unclosed the Holy Book. On the knees of the Mem
Sahiba sat her little boy Henry, a lovely blue-eyed
child of four years of age.</p>

<p>The Sahib read about heaven; of the bright
happy home of those who have believed in the Lord
Jesus Christ, and who, believing, have loved and
obeyed Him. Melo did not know this part of the
Bible at all. She listened with delight to the
account of the glorious place, till the reader came to
the following words:—<i>And there shall in no wise
enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever
worketh abomination, or maketh a lie</i> (Rev.
xxi. 27).</p>

<p>Melo was startled to hear this. “Shall I be shut
out from heaven?” she said to herself. But Melo
could not even yet make up her mind to tell her
Mem Sahiba all the truth about her beautiful scent-bottle.</p>

<p>When prayers were over, Melo was ordered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
take Baba Henry into the garden; for it was the
cold season, and the weather was not yet too hot.
Melo loved children very much, and it was with
pleasure that she watched the gambols of the fair
little English boy.</p>

<p>Henry ran about the garden, and in his play he
forgot to keep to the gravel path. Carelessly running
across the border, the child brushed past a
beautiful flower which he knew that his mother
greatly prized, and in doing so broke off its head.
The child stood still at once, and looked with vexation
at the mischief which he had done.</p>

<p>“Oh! mamma told me not to run over the
border, or to touch the flowers! She will be so
vexed!” cried the child, almost bursting into tears.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Baba Henry,” said Melo; “you
need say nothing to the Mem Sahiba about the
matter.”</p>

<p>The boy looked indignantly into the face of the
ayah with his steady blue eyes. “If I did not tell
the truth, God would be angry,” he cried; and off
darted the child, to confess everything to his mother.</p>

<p>Melo looked after him, and tears came into her
eyes. “Shall that little one fear God and speak
truth?” she exclaimed; “and shall I, who have
given myself to the God of truth, tell lies like a
heathen? O Lord! help me to put away this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
sin!” And quickly Melo followed her little charge,
and confessed to her Mem Sahiba that she had
thrown down and cracked her bottle.</p>

<p>And was the Mem Sahiba angry? No; her
words were: “I thank God that I have at last a
servant whose word I can trust.”</p>

<h3 id="XI_10">X.—THE FALL, THE CHEETAH, AND THE CUP.</h3>

<p>Jai Singh, a man of good family, but poor, stood
by the side of the road as Parduman, once his boyhood’s
companion, rode by. Parduman was mounted
on an Arab horse of great value, richly caparisoned;
and two syces attended their master. Envy and
covetousness awoke in the heart of Jai Singh as he
gazed.</p>

<p>“Why should that fellow have all life’s honey,
and I he left the gall?” he exclaimed. “Would
that your horse were mine; ay, and the heavy bags
of rupees also, that have fallen to the lot of one less
worthy than myself to possess them!”</p>

<p>“O my son, beware of desiring that which is
another’s!” said Isaac, the aged catechist, who had
been a friend and teacher of Jai Singh from his
childhood, and who, chancing to be near, had overheard
the exclamation. “In the Word of God it is
written: <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his
man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s</i>”
(Ex. xx. 17).</p>

<p>“What matters the thought, if the act be blameless?”
inquired Jai Singh. “I will never lift up
my hand to steal or to slay.”</p>

<p>“As the seed to the plant, as the crocodile’s egg
to the living reptile, so is the thought of the heart to
the deed of the hand,” answered old Isaac. “Man
seeth the action, God searcheth the heart. In God’s
sight he that hateth, murders; and he that coveteth,
steals. It is written in the Bible: <i>The love of
money is the root of all evil</i> (1 Tim. vi. 10). Dig
up the root, and no poisonous fruits can appear.”</p>

<p>Jai Singh shrank from the purity of such a
religion as this, which must convict all men of sin
before God. Rather impatiently he said, “Unless
evil be seen, I deny that it is evil at all.”</p>

<p>“Hear an incident of my life which has been to
me as a parable,” said old Isaac. “Before I had
one white hair in my beard, I went on a journey in
a mountainous part of our land. Going up a steep
place, my horse stumbled and threw me, and I fell
down a precipice; but my dress caught in some
bushes, and though hurt I was able to regain the
road and again mount my horse. Riding on again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
I had not gone far when a cheetah burst from the
thicket, and suddenly sprang upon me. I was a
strong man then, and carried a sharp knife in my
girdle; after a struggle the cheetah was killed, but
I bear on me the marks of its claws to this day.
Weary and weakened by the loss of blood, I was
forced to stop at the nearest house, though it was
the house of one whom I had known as a deadly
enemy. He received me with sullen looks, but
denied me not rest nor food. He brought to me a
cup of wine, and I drank it; I knew not that there
was poison in the cup. The evil that I saw not,
O Jai Singh! was worse than the more startling
dangers through which I had passed. I suffered
more from the poison hidden in my frame, than
from the fall down the precipice, or the claws of the
cheetah.”</p>

<p>“How is it that you are here to-day, if you were
poisoned?” inquired Jai Singh.</p>

<p>“When, after leaving my enemy’s house, I arrived
at the place for which I was bound,” replied Isaac,
“I was in sore sickness and pain; but I found there
a doctor of great skill, who gave me a powerful
antidote, and after much suffering I rose from my
sick-bed healed. And from the Christian doctor I
also received knowledge of the only antidote for sin,—whether
it be the open sin which man condemns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
or the poison of sin, such as covetousness, lying
concealed in the heart.”</p>

<p>“He taught you Christianity,” observed Jai Singh.</p>

<p>“He taught me that for all past sin there is one
remedy freely offered by God to all who truly
believe: <i>The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth
us from all sin</i> (1 John i. 7). But we need more
than to be saved from the punishment of sin; we
need to be saved from its power. The heart, the
seat of evil, must itself be made pure by the Holy
Spirit of God. And this Spirit is promised in
answer to prayer. Let us cry, with David in the
psalm: <i>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew
a right spirit within me</i> (Psalm li. 10). For thus
spake the Saviour of mankind: <i>If ye, being evil,
know how to give good gifts to your children: how
much more shall your heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?</i>” (Luke xi. 13.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Those conversant with India need not be told that a fearful want of truthfulness
prevails amongst the natives. Against this evil the attention of missionaries
has been earnestly directed, and in some cases with great success.
A. L. O. E. heard since her arrival a story of a school in Calcutta (she believes,
however, that it was a Eurasian school). A prize was offered in it for truthfulness,
and as it would have been almost impossible for a teacher to have adjudged
the prize to the satisfaction of all, to the girls themselves the decision was left.
All the children fixed upon one of their companions as the most truthful girl in
the school. The wisdom of their choice was shown by the conscientious girl’s
declining to accept the prize, for she did not think herself <i>truthful enough</i> to
deserve it!</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The first native of India who saw the translation of this little story—a refined
and educated man—was much struck by the new view presented to him of his
parental duty. He actually, very shortly afterwards, <i>punished his child for telling
a lie</i>. The little boy was probably surprised at receiving chastisement for what
is usually deemed such a very trifling offence; but the punishment (not a severe
one) seemed to have made an impression on his young mind. Soon afterwards,
on his sister asking him whether something which he had said were true, the
child, with a new sense of the evil of falsehood, said, “Do you not know that
God is angry when we tell lies?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> In happy England, the difficulty of crossing the river of Baptism to many
converts in India can hardly be appreciated. To do so is to pass the Rubicon,
to cut the tie which connects the believer with all that was dear upon earth, to
cast away honour, friendship, enjoyment; it is indeed to take up the Cross!
One of our noblest Punjaubi Christians lingered five years before he was given
courage to cross the river. One youth was brought into court to declare
whether it was his deliberate choice to become a Christian. His mother drew
forth a knife, and told her son that if he were baptized she would plunge it into
her own bosom! I have seen another youth who could well bear witness to the
sharpness of the thorns of Persecution. His own father made him stand in <i>boiling
oil</i>, till the skin was burnt off his poor feet! But he has crossed the river.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> A tendency to fatalism in the Oriental character is one of the great difficulties
with which missionaries have to contend. It gives to the timid convert an excuse
for indolence and apathy. “If it be God’s will, I shall have the blessing,”
he thinks or professes to think “without making any struggle to obtain it.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Let not the meaning of my little parable be misunderstood. Even the true
believer must expect many assaults of Temptation, many a struggle with besetting
sin. The pearl, Purity, is perfected only in a brighter world. Nevertheless,
not only Christ’s imputed righteousness, but a <i>growing likeness</i> to Him
who said, “Learn of Me,” is one of God’s free gifts to His children through the
indwelling of His Spirit. It is particularly necessary to enforce this truth in a
land like India, where even sincere converts find it very hard to lead <i>consistent</i>
lives, after having been brought up in the paths of sin.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> This is a natural view to be taken by one half persuaded, who would make
the inconsistencies of professed believers an excuse for not joining their ranks.
It is but fair, however, to the native Christians, for whom this tale was specially

is adopted by their heathen neighbours.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The convert probably restrained himself lest his mother should refuse to accept

from Amritsar, but the words which produced a reconciliation were really spoken
by one of the four who had quarrelled. A. L. O. E. heard a graphic account of
the scene from a gentleman who had been present. That the reconciliation was
not merely outward, seems to be proved by the fact that some little time afterwards
the four Christian villagers came in a body and partook of the Holy
Communion in the mission church of Amritsar.</p>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
